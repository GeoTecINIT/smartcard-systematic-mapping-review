AB The term "user persona" recently has become more popular and can reflect the characteristics and needs of each user. To analyze the individual characteristics of each passenger in order to better implement targeted transportation policies, a method to mine travel profiles from each passenger based on their smart card transaction records is proposed, mainly mining six labels of passengers: activity, loyalty, whether they are stable commuters, where they live, where they work, and how they prefer to travel. A case study was conducted in the Huitian area of Beijing, the largest community in Asia, which demonstrated the high practicality and accuracy of the passenger profiling method. The results show that 33.06% of passengers were given the stable commuter label and were more likely to have high activity and loyalty labels, whereas 66.94% of other passengers were more likely to have low activity and loyalty labels; 88.9% of passengers were given the residence label and 67.71% of stable commuters received the workplace label, with an accuracy rate of over 90% according to a travel survey. In addition, the application of passenger labels during the design of demand responsive transit (DRT) was discussed to illustrate how to use the labels to improve the efficiency of DRT. The proposed passenger profiling method is applicable to the data mining of passenger travel labels in a simple and accurate way, and can help public transport service providers and researchers to study individual passenger characteristics and provide a theoretical basis for transit network planning and personalization measures.

AB In urban areas, public transport can improve sustainable transport by reducing vehicles and congestion, and improving accessibility. Mass rapid transit (MRT) is especially important for large cities, such as Taipei City, Taiwan. In particular, MRT aims to improve mobility and reliability, but has limitations in providing first and last mile accessibility to final destinations or origins. Taipei City, Taiwan has introduced a public bike sharing scheme to service this gap. However, few studies have addressed how a public bike sharing scheme assists first and last mile accessibility. This study uses Taipei City as a case study to investigate this issue by comparing the demand and supply of the public bike sharing scheme, YouBike, at a detailed spatial scale. The supply of YouBike is represented by the time saving compared to walking for each identified origin and destination pair in the study area (i.e., Point of Interests (POIs) and MRT stations). The demand for YouBike is total trips from each YouBike station to a MRT station using public transport smart card data. By comparing the demand and supply for over 400 zones or villages, service gaps and areas of unbalanced service can be identified. The results show that YouBike does provide first and last mile service for the MRT network with some evidence of service mismatch in the study area, i.e., high service for low demand and vice versa. The conclusions of the paper can help cities wanting to introduce a bike sharing schemes to improve first and last mile transport.

AB Shared micro-mobility has been booming in recent years and the coordinated development of different modes can play an important role in improving the connectivity of the urban public transport system. While most previous studies have analysed the feeder trips of individual modes, few comparative studies of different modes have been conducted. To this end, we compared the spatial and temporal patterns in the integrated use of station -based bikeshare systems (SBBS) and free-floating bikeshare systems (FFBS) with the metro. This study used the smart card data of SBBS and transaction data of FFBS from 1st to 30th September 2017, in Nanjing, China. Generalised additive mixed models were applied to examine the nuanced effects of the built environment, weather factors and temporal variables, while taking into account spatio-temporal autocorrelations. The results show that SBBS are used more as a feeder mode at downtown metro stations and exhibit pronounced rush hour patterns. FFBS-metro integrated use is spatially more dispersed at peripheral stations and covers wider periods of the day. This suggests that SBBS use is more demand-driven, while FFBS use is more efficiency-driven. The built environment shows different forms of effects: variables that have a linear relationship with SBBS-metro inte-grated use show non-linear effects in the FFBS model, and vice versa. Certain variables also present variations in their non-linear patterns. For instance, the plateau effect of road density for SBBS occurs at 10.5 km/km2, while the optimal employment density for FFBS is 12,000 jobs/km2. Inadequate or excessive development can lead to a decrease in integration efficiency. These findings can inform how service providers optimise fleet reallocation and how transport planners tailor spatial interventions that promote the integration of bikeshare and the metro system.

AB Public transport has become an essential part of urban existence with increased population densities and environmental awareness. Large quantities of data are currently generated, allowing for more robust methods to understand travel behavior by harvesting smart card usage. However, public transport datasets suffer from data integrity problems; boarding stop information may be missing due to imperfect acquirement processes or inadequate reporting. This study introduces a supervised machine learning method to impute missing boarding stops based on ordinal classification using GTFS timetable, smart card, and geospatial datasets. A new metric, Pareto Accuracy, is suggested to evaluate algorithms where classes have an ordinal nature. The results are based on a case study in the city of Beer Sheva, Israel, consisting of one month of smart card data. We show that our proposed method is robust to irregular travelers and significantly outperforms well-known imputation methods without the need to mine any additional datasets. The data validation from another Israeli city using transfer learning shows the presented model is general and context-free. The implications for transportation planning and travel behavior research are further discussed.

AB Background The provision of seamless public transport supply requires a complete understanding of the real traffic dynamics, comprising origin-to-destination multimodal mobility patterns along the transport network. However, most current solutions are centred on the volumetric analysis of passengers' flows, generally neglecting transfer, walking, and waiting needs, as well as the changes in the mobility patterns with the calendar and user profile. These challenges prevent a comprehensive assessment of the routing and scheduling vulnerabilities of (multimodal) public transport networks. Research aims/questions The research presented in this paper aims at addressing the above challenges by proposing a novel approach that extends dynamic Origin-Destination (OD) matrix inference to dynamic OD matrix inference with aggregated statistics, highlighting vulnerabilities and multimodal mobility patterns from individual trip record data. Methodology Given specific spatial and temporal criteria, the proposed methodology extends dynamic Origin-Destination (OD) matrices with aggregated statistics, using smart-card validations gathered from (multimodal) public transport networks. More specifically, three major contributions are tackled; i) the data enrichment in the OD matrices with statistical information besides trip volume (e.g., transfer and trip features); ii) the detection of vulnerabilities on the network pertaining to walking distances and trip durations in a user-centric way and iii) the decomposition of traffic flows in accordance with calendrical rules and user (passenger) profiles. The set of contributions are validated on the bus-and-metro public transport network in the city of Lisbon. Results The proposed approach for inferring OD matrices yields four unique contributions. First, we allow inference to consider multimodal commuting patterns, detecting individual trips undertaken along with different operators. Second, we support dynamic matrices' OD inference along with parameterizable time intervals and calendrical rules, and further support the decomposition of traffic flows according to the user profile. Third, we allow parameterization of the desirable spatial granularity and visualisation preferences. Fourth, our solution efficiently computes several statistics that support OD matrix analysis, helping with the detection of vulnerabilities throughout the transport network. More specifically, statistical indicators related to travellers' functional mobility needs (commuters for working purposes, etc.), walking distances and trip durations are supported. The inferred dynamic OD matrices are the outcome of a developed software with strict guarantees of usability. Results from the case study using data gathered from the two main public transport operators (Bus and Metro) in the city of Lisbon show that 77.3% of alighting stops can be estimated with a high confidence degree from bus smart-card data. The inferred OD matrices (Bus and Metro) in the city of Lisbon reveal vulnerabilities along specific OD pairs, offering the bus public operators in Lisbon new knowledge and a means to better understand dynamics and validate OD assumptions.

AB Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning strategy to encourage the use of public transportation by clustering urban development centering on transit stations with dense and diverse land uses. TOD typology is important information for the urban planner to monitor and improve the TOD. However, many studies have focused only on static features such as land use and population density around the transit station. Such analysis does not reflect dynamic features based on human mobility patterns. This study focuses on a series of processes that evaluate the activity-based TOD typology of the transit station based on smart-card data. To consider the context of multimodal transit system, transit station areas consisting of one subway station and multiple bus stops are created and clustered according to the proportion of the identified activities. Passengers' trip-chain with missing activities are clustered by applying a hidden Markov model (HMM), and the activities are identi-fied through land use and temporal patterns. Interpretation of each cluster is made through spatio-temporal patterns. The results provide six types of identified activities that are well aligned with general expectations. The transit station areas in Seoul, which were clustered with six identified types, describe the urban spatial structure, which is spatially distributed around a business district in order of mixed and residential zones. Also, the same category of clusters shows different functions depending on temporal patterns, indicating the need for consideration of dynamic features. Our approach provides insights into transit station changes throughout the day that has been overlooked in previous studies by considering the passenger's sequence of activity, start, and duration.

AB This paper presents a data fusion method to infer the origin and destination zones of transit trips from smart card data. The fusion framework has disaggregate mixed multinomial logit models at its core that predict the most probable origin and destination zones of individual transit trips using smart card transaction records, land use data, and transit system characteristics. The logit models are estimated using revealed trip origin and destination responses from a travel survey that are augmented by land use and transit system data to provide contexts about the zones' trip generation and attraction potentials. For empirical analysis, the methodology is applied to the smart card system of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Specifically, it is tested under different system configurations (tap-on-only and tap-on-and-off) and for networks with sub-stantial shares of automobile and walk access/egress. When applied to transit trips constructed from the smart card transactions, the estimated models successfully capture the spatial distri-bution of trip origin and destination at the traffic analysis zone level. The empirical analysis also demonstrates that the proposed fusion method can be appropriately used to reconcile information provided by transit smart card and travel surveys to generate up-to-date transit demand data necessary for public transport planning and operations.

AB The digital screens installed inside subway stations generate advertisement revenue by displaying advertisements to passengers. Digital advertisements are increasingly preferred by advertisers because of the high traffic volumes in subway. This paper designs a digital advertising system based on the historical demand information extracted from the smart card data. To this end, we propose a method of designing advertisement products tailored to the digital screens in subway. Next, we consider a reservation system for the designed products with an objective of maximizing the advertisement revenue. The linear programming model is used for the reservation control. If the reservation requests arrive with a Poisson process, the dynamic programming model is used for a more accurate control. The final problem to address is how to schedule the accepted reservations for a maximum exposure to subway passengers. The scheduling problem is the traditional knapsack problem, and the simple greedy method is optimal. Numerical study is performed using our real-life smart card data from Daegu, South Korea. Our data set does not have the demographic information. For the case where this information is available, this paper describes the model for the location-based targeted advertising.

AB Understanding the determinants of elderly people's public transport usage patterns can offer new insights into elderly mobility issues and provide policy implications for planning toward an aging-friendly and sustainable city. However, few studies have examined the impact of the built environment on the trip time of the elderly using big data. Moreover, the elderly's trip time has been mostly investigated by the multivariate linear regression model (MLR), ignoring the non-linear association between explanatory variables and trip time. Using smart card data from Nanjing in 2019, this study employs a gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) model to probe into the correlations between the built environment and the elderly's trip time. The results show that significant non-linear relationships exist between trip time and the selected explanatory variables, which cannot be captured by the MLR model. It suggests that relevant policy implementations should be carried out in conjunction with the elderly's travel environment by regarding their threshold effects. Besides, interaction effects of spatial attributes on trip time are identified in our study. For example, elderly people living in the exurban area are more likely to take long-distance metro travel for their physical exercise. These findings demonstrate that planners and policymakers should not only consider one single built-environment factor, but also the interactions of various factors to enhance elderly mobility.

AB Buses and metros are two main public transit modes, and these modes are crucial components of sustainable transportation systems. Promoting reciprocal integration between bus and metro systems requires a deep un-derstanding of the effects of multiple factors on transfers among integrated public transportation transfer modes, i.e., metro-to-bus and bus-to-metro. This study aims to reveal the determinants of the transfer ratio between bus and metro systems and quantify the associated impacts. The transfer ratio between buses and metros is identified based on large-scale transaction data from automated fare collection systems. Meanwhile, various influencing factors, including weather, socioeconomic, the intensity of business activities, and built environment factors, are obtained from multivariate sources. A multivariate regression model is used to investigate the associations be-tween the transfer ratio and multiple factors. The results show that the transfer ratio of the two modes signifi-cantly increases under high temperature, strong wind, rainfall, and low visibility. The morning peak hours attract a transfer ratio of up to 57.95%, and the average hourly transfer volume is 0.94 to 1.38 times higher at this time than in other periods. The intensity of business activities has the most significant impact on the transfer ratio, which is approximately 1.5 to 15 times that of the other independent variables. Moreover, an adaptative geographically weighted regression is utilized to investigate the spatial divergences of the influences of critical factors on the transfer ratio. The results indicate that the impact of a factor presents spatial heterogeneity and even shows opposite effects (in terms of positive and negative) on the transfer ratio in different urban contexts. For example, among the related socioeconomic variables, the impact of the housing price on the downtown transfer ratio is larger than that in the suburbs. Crowd density positively influences the transfer ratio at most stations in the northern region, whereas it shows negative results in the southern region. These findings provide valuable insights for public transportation management and promote the effective integration of bus and metro systems to provide enhanced transfer services.

AB Fare policy plays an important role in transit operations and management. To better coordinate and achieve the multidimensional goals of a proposed fare adjustment policy (e.g., increasing revenue, managing demand, and improving equity), a fundamental step is to evaluate its travel pattern impacts, which helps us consider the policy in a bigger socioeconomic context. Existing studies rarely investigate the impacts of such a policy on different users' and user groups' travel patterns and transit operators' farebox revenue using longitudinal data from sources such as smartcard data. To fill this gap, we exploit 24 weeks' smartcard data from Wuhan, China, to empirically quantify those impacts. We find that (a) the fare increase had significant but varying impacts on travel patterns across users and user groups; (b) confronting the fare increase, commuter groups identified by the topic model reduced their trip frequency more but later as compared to other groups; (c) low-accessibility, long-distance, and single-destination metro riders were less sensitive to the fare increase; (d) when there was a system-wide fare increase with a distance-based structure, trip purposes and socioeconomic statuses could better predict the impacts on the travel demand and farebox revenue than spatiality. These findings indicate that increasing average fares while offering discounted tickets for frequent and/or captive riders could maintain the existing ridership and farebox revenue and possibly increase additional ridership.

AB Accurate short-term forecasting of public transport demand is essential for the operation of ondemand public transport. Knowing where and when future demands for travel are expected allows operators to adjust timetables quickly, which helps improve service quality and reliability and attract more passengers to public transport. This study addresses this need by developing AIbased deep learning models for prediction of bus passenger demands based on actual patronage data obtained from the smart-card ticketing system in Melbourne. The models, which consider the temporal characteristics of travel demand for some of the heaviest bus routes in Melbourne, were developed using real-world data from 18 bus routes and 1,781 bus stops. LSTM and BiLSTM deep learning models were evaluated and compared with five conventional deep learning models using the same data set. A desktop comparison was also undertaken against a number of established demand forecasting models that have been reported in the literature over the past decade. The comparative evaluation results showed that BiLSTM models outperformed other models tested and was able to predict passenger demands with over 90% accuracy.

AB Individual travel prediction is very important for the construction of intelligent urban transportation systems. Previous studies mainly focus on the improvement of algorithms, but pay little attention to the mining of data information. In this paper, the concept of the travel pattern is introduced into the field of individual travel prediction of frequent bus passengers. The travel pattern of passengers refers to the trip with similar boarding time and similar boarding and alighting stations of the same person. Through clustering the travel pattern by DBSCAN algorithm, the regularity of passenger travel can be better exploited and travel information can be integrated into a unified unit as well. In the process of prediction, we first predict whether the passenger will travel, and then, if so, predict the probability distribution of the next trip conditional on the previous one. The proposed method is tested using the Automatic Fare Collection data of Chengdu's frequent bus passengers in May 2019. Based on travel pattern, the average accuracy of travel information prediction is about 41%, which is 13% higher than the method without using travel pattern. Furthermore, this paper also discusses the influence of spatial threshold in clustering on the prediction results.

AB The paper aims to examine bus passengers' route choice behavior in the context of transfer penalty estimation. Methodologically, it leverages passengers' stop-level trip information inferred from automatic vehicle location (AVL) and automated fare collection (AFC) data and compares the stop-level origin-destination (O-D) pairs with direct paths and transfer paths. The route choice models were established with the inclusion of normalized travel frequency as a key variable. A case study was performed using the trip data of adult card holders from the bus systems in Chengdu, China. The results show that the normalized travel frequency is a variable that makes an informative contribution to the explanation of passenger route choices. Specifically, passengers with higher travel frequency prefer to choose the transfer path. Moreover, the transfer penalty function in the context of the monthly travel frequency was obtained and shows that the travel frequency can reduce a passenger's transfer penalty. Finally, the stabilities of the normalized travel frequency function and transfer penalty function were assessed using the trip data from the weekdays in four weeks with the results showing that the normalized travel frequency function is similar in shape. In addition, the relationship between a passenger's monthly travel frequency and their familiarity with the bus network was discussed using the second derivative of the normalized travel frequency function.

AB Predictions on Public Transport (PT) ridership are beneficial as they allow for sufficient and cost-efficient deployment of vehicles. On an operational level, this relates to short-term predictions with lead times of less than an hour. Where conventional data sources on ridership, such as Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data, may have longer lag times and contain no travel intentions, in contrast, trip planner data are often available in (near) real-time and are used before traveling. In this paper, we investigate how such data from a trip planner app can be utilized for short-term bus ridership predictions. This is combined with AFC data (in this case smart card data) to construct a ground truth on actual ridership. Using informative variables from the trip planner dataset through correlation analysis, we develop 3 supervised Machine Learning (ML) models, including k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting. The best-performing model relies on random forest regression with trip planner requests. Compared with the baseline model that depends on the weekly trend, it reduces the mean absolute error by approximately half. Moreover, using the same model with and without trip planner data, we prove the usefulness of trip planner data by an improved mean absolute error of 8.9% and 21.7% and an increased coefficient of determination from a 5-fold cross-validation of 7.8% and 18.5% for two case study lines, respectively. Lastly, we show that this model performance is maintained even for the trip planner requests with prediction lead times up to 30 min ahead, and for different periods of the day. We expect our methodology to be useful for PT operators to elevate their daily operations and level of service as well as for trip planner companies to facilitate passenger replanning, in particular during peak hours.

AB Smart card data have received increasing interest from transport researchers for travel behavior investigation. However, the utility of smart card data has arguably yet to be exploited in the spatio-temporal context of interpreting the essential properties of passenger groups. Before building socially responsible data models, considering ethics issues of what is right, just and fair is able to minimize negative impacts of technology. This work demonstrates a multi-phase methodology to illustrate the essential properties of passenger groups with crowd mobility portraits that are presented by several words in combination with visualized maps. In particular, we propose an efficient ranking algorithm to figure out trajectories mostly contributing to the city-wide mobility patterns and construct time-varying land functions to textualize trajectories and obtain interpretable crowd mobility portraits. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy improvement of 8%. Case studies of real-world data also confirm the effectiveness of crowd mobility portraits.

AB With the abundance of public transportation in highly urbanized areas, it is common for passengers to make inefficient or flawed transport decisions due to a lack of information. The exact arrival time of a bus is an example of such information that can aid passengers in making better decisions. The purpose of this study is to provide a method for predicting path-based bus travel time, thereby assisting accurate bus arrival and departure time predictions at each bus stop. Specifically, we develop a Geo-conv Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model that (1) extracts subsequent spatial features through a 1D Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for the entire bus travel sequence and (2) captures the temporal dependencies between subsequences through the LSTM network. Additionally, this study utilizes additional variables that affect two components of bus travel time (dwelling time and transit time) to precisely predict travel time. The constructed model is then evaluated by the practical application to two bus lines operating in Seoul, Korea. The results show that our model outperforms three other baseline models. Two bus lines with different types of operation show different model performance patterns that are dependent on travel distance. Interestingly, we find that the variable related to the link of the stop location appears to play an important role in predicting bus travel time. We believe that these novel findings will contribute to the literature on transportation and, in particular, on deep learning-based travel time prediction.

AB Urban and regional areas worldwide exhibit a complex and uneven distribution of activities with certain areas attracting more people during different time periods. In this study we systemically classify different parts of the urban area which are most attractive as measured by their ability to attract visitors. A weekly visiting profile is constructed for each travel demand zone and thereafter clustered to identify areas with common attraction patterns. We leverage on the availability of longitudinal individual mobility traces in the form of smart card data transactions. We apply our method to the case study of the multi-modal public trans-port system of the Stockholm urban agglomeration area. The results of our clustering based on the weekly visiting profiles reveal four distinctive types of visiting attraction based on the intensity and temporal distribution of activities performed. The results of this study can be used to inform planners and decision makers about the main activity locations of travellers and how their temporal patterns vary across the metropolitan area and the design of related policies.

AB Passengers generate travel behaviours on public transit, whose variations deserve an exploration with an aim to guide daily-updated managements. In this study, we investigate temporal variability in travel patterns for over 3.3 million passengers across 120 days who use public transit in Beijing. Temporal variability is characterized by a series of features in terms of space coverage, travel distance and travel frequency, based on which, passengers are clustered into two types, that is, commuters with daily travel routines, and non-commuters who do not. How, and to which extent, they change travel patterns over time are examined, with using approaches concerning multivariate regression and curve fitting. Results show that, (1) commuters are more likely to travel longer but cover less territory than non-commuters on weekdays, while the opposite patterns occur on weekends. The variation of day of week affects commuters less, compared to non-commuters, due to more fixed schedules, as expected; (2) travel distance and frequency are found to increase faster, more linearly, than space-coverage features, the last of which experience a progressive decreasing of marginal increases before reaching a plateau. The above findings facilitate transport practitioners to design sound management schemes for passengers in different categories.

AB Previous studies show that the popularity of bike-sharing systems has a significant impact on public transit ridership, mainly reflected in two aspects: substitution and supplement. However, a mode choice of the users between bike-sharing and bus for the last-mile connection to urban rails has not been sufficiently studied using actual traffic sensor data. Therefore, in this study, the binomial choice behavior between bike-sharing and buses as a last-mile connection to urban rails in Beijing, China, is analyzed and modeled using the feeder subchain information of bus and bike-sharing for 1 week that is extracted from transit smart card data, cycling record data, and station location information data. We specifically focus on the moderate distance (0.5-3 km), within which distance the bike-sharing is a rival and suitable alternative to the bus. A binomial logit model is constructed to examine the mode choice between buses and shared bikes as a last-mile connection to urban rail. In addition to the general explanatory variables (i.e., travel distance, travel time, and cost), built environments such as housing density, land uses, and bike-lane conditions are also considered in our study. Results show that the walking distance from the metro station has a stronger effect on the users' mode choice than the total subchain distance. A longer travel time increases the preference for taking the bus. We also find that users are most likely to choose the bus in the evening rush hours, followed by offpeak times and the morning rush hours. The existence of bike lanes, especially with isolation belts alongside them, increases the probability that people choose shared bikes. As bus and bike-sharing are the two most popular and economically competitive urban rail egress modes for a moderate distance in China, understanding the determinants of mode choice contributes to better planning and operational strategies for both feeder bus and bike-sharing systems.

ID TO-DAY VARIABILITY; BEHAVIOR; USAGE
AB A better understanding of travel pattern variability is important for public transport (PT) authorities to improve passenger experience and service provision. Although many studies have examined the travel pattern variability of PT users, these studies are often limited to a short analysis period or to only one dimension of travel behavior. In addition, there is limited knowledge of how the demographic characteristics of PT users are associated with their travel pattern variability. To address these limitations, we develop a novel measure that simultaneously considers multiple dimensions of travel behavior to quantify the intrapersonal variability in weekly PT usage. Moreover, we examine interpersonal variability by identifying clusters of users who share similar weekly profiles. Based on smart card transaction data for 52 weeks and an anonymous cardholder database (including age and gender) from Shizuoka, Japan, we analyze the intrapersonal and interpersonal variability in weekly PT usage as well as the role of gender and age in travel pattern variability. The results indicate that gender and age play an important role in the travel pattern variability of PT users. Female users exhibit higher intrapersonal variability than their male counterparts. Weekly patterns are the most diverse for users aged 70 or over, followed by the users aged 65-69. Regarding interpersonal variability, we identify five clusters of users, each characterized by a distinct weekly profile and associated with certain age and gender.

AB The accurate prediction of short-term passenger flow is of high importance to efficiently manage the passenger flow of metro systems and adjust timetable accordingly. However, the existing methods of passenger flow prediction cannot achieve adequate accurate results due to its complex nonlinear spatiotemporal characteristics. To improve the accuracy of short-term passenger flow prediction, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on a spatiotemporal framework. Firstly, the graph convolutional network, which incorporates prior domain knowledge (such as travel time and origin-destination demand), is used to extract spatial features of passenger flow. Secondly, the attention mechanism is integrated into the gated recurrent unit to extract the time correlation of passenger flow. Finally, external factors are introduced to capture their impact on passenger flow as well. A case study of the Beijing Subway system is illustrated to verify the performance of the proposed model. The results show that compared with the existing models, the proposed model achieves the highest prediction accuracy and strong robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adjacency matrix based on travel time outperforms the one based on OD demand, especially during evening peak hours. In addition, it is also verified that the attention mechanism and external factors can improve the prediction performance of the proposed model.

AB The large-scale data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems provide opportunities for researching both individual travelling behavior and mobility pattern in urban city. In existent researching files, AFC data focuses on detecting riders' travel patterns. However, we leverage such data for detecting suspects exhibiting abnormal behaviors, such as "suspected theft", "suspected begging" and "suspected unauthorized advertisement". This paper first explores irregular data of "In-Out" in the same subway station (IOSSS) to extract the anomaly behavior of subway riders. IOSSS is defined as the riders entering and leaving via the same subway station. Then, it proposes a novel spatiotemporal feature map for those abnormal behaviors based on user clustering and ride behavior analysis. Finally, it proposes a spatial attention module+dense connected convolutional network (SAM+DenseNet) framework to distinguish abnormal suspects from regular passengers. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, with a precision value of 93.1%, a recall value of 97.3% and an F1 value of 95.2%. The visualization of the attention module could help police and public safety departments understand the features of abnormal behavior. Findings from this research can assist police and public safety departments in the city in taking proactive actions to track down suspects exhibiting abnormal behaviors.

AB Station-based bike sharing (SBBS) not only provides commuters with direct "door-to-door" trips, but also plays a vital role in addressing the "first/last mile" challenges for public transportation system. However, there is a lack of research into portraying year-to-year changes in SBBS commuter behaviors. With five-year (from 2016 to 2020) SBBS smart card data collected in Nanjing, China, a longitudinal analysis is performed in this study to trace yearly dynamics of commuter behaviors at an individual level. We identify two sorts of SBBS commuters (i.e., SBBS-alone and SBBS-metro commuters) based on users' spatial-temporal travel regularities. The paper finds that (i) the number of SBBS users presented a considerable fluctuation trend over a five-year span, while the pro-portion of SBBS commuters stabilized at an equilibrium level; (ii) the COVID-19 outbreak accelerated the decline in the proportion of female and young SBBS commuters; (iii) most SBBS commuters were recorded for only one year out of five, while the share of commuters who used SBBS for four years or more is tiny, <5%; (iv) the trip duration of SBBS-alone commuters was significantly longer than that of SBBS-metro commuters, and both showed some increase during the COVID-19 pandemic; (v) the number of non-loop trip chains was dramatically higher than that of loop trip chains, which is more prominent among SBBS-metro commuters. Our findings could provide valuable insights into the behavioral dynamics of SBBS commuters and offer recommendations on how policy makers and transportation planners could respond to these precipitate changes.

AB Forecasting short-term ridership of different origin-destination pairs (i.e., OD matrix) is crucial to the real-time operation of a metro system. However, this problem is notoriously difficult due to the large-scale, high-dimensional, noisy, and highly skewed nature of OD matrices. In this paper, we address the short-term OD matrix forecasting problem by estimating a low-rank high-order vector autoregression (VAR) model. We reconstruct this problem as a data-driven reduced-order regression model and estimate it using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The VAR coefficients estimated by DMD are the best-fit (in terms of Frobenius norm) linear operator for the rank-reduced full-size data. To address the practical issue that metro OD matrices cannot be observed in real time, we use the boarding demand to replace the unavailable OD matrices. Moreover, we consider the time-evolving feature of metro systems and improve the forecast by exponentially reducing the weights for historical data. A tailored online update algorithm is then developed for the high-order weighted DMD model (HW-DMD) to update the model coefficients at a daily level, without storing historical data or retraining. Experiments on data from two large-scale metro systems show that the proposed HW-DMD is robust to noisy and sparse data, and significantly outperforms baseline models in forecasting both OD matrices and boarding flow. The online update algorithm also shows consistent accuracy over a long time, allowing us to maintain an HW-DMD model at much low costs.

AB Timely and accurate prediction of human movement in urban areas offers instructive insights into transportation management, public safety, and location-based services, to name a few. Yet, modeling urban mobility is challenging and complex because of the spatiotemporal dynamics of movement behavior and the influence of exogenous factors such as weather, holidays, and local events. In this paper, we use bus transportation as a proxy to mine spatiotemporal travel patterns. We propose a deep-learning-based urban mobility prediction model that collectively forecasts passenger flows between pairs of city regions in an origin-destination (OD) matrix. We first process OD matrices in a convolutional neural network to capture spatial correlations. Intermediate results are reconstructed into three multivariate time series: hourly, daily, and weekly time series. Each time series is aggregated in a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a novel attention mechanism to guide the aggregation. In addition, our model is context-aware by using contextual embeddings learned from exogenous factors. We dynamically merge results from LSTM components and context embeddings in a late fusion network to make a final prediction. The proposed model is implemented and evaluated using a large-scale transportation data set of more than 200 million bus trips with a suite of Big Data technologies developed for data processing. Through performance comparison, we show that our approach achieves sizable accuracy improvements in urban mobility prediction. Our work has major implications for efficient transportation system design and performance improvement. The proposed deep neural network structure is generally applicable for sequential graph data prediction.

AB Unreliable waiting times may cause frustration and anxiety amongst public transport travellers. Although the effect of travel time reliability has been studied extensively, most studies have used stated preferences which have disadvantages, such as an inherent hypothetical bias, or have analysed revealed preferences for road traffic. Here, we derive revealed preferences from passively collected smart card data to analyse the role of waiting time reliability in public transport route choice. We study waiting time reliability as regular and irregular deviations from scheduled values, examining a number of indicators for the latter. Behaviour in morning peak and off-peak hours is contrasted and differences in reliability coefficients for different modes in the network, and for origin and transfer stops are reported. Results from The Hague indicate relatively low reliability ratios with travellers perceiving a 5-minute standard deviation in realised waiting times as an extra 1-5.6 min of planned waiting time.

TI Travel time prediction of urban public transportation based on detection

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Improving travel time prediction for public transit effectively enhances service reliability, optimizes travel structure, and alleviates traffic problems. Its greater time-variance and uncertainty make predictions for short travel times (<= 35min) more subject to be influenced by random factors. It requires higher precision and is more complicated than long-term predictions. Effectively extracting and mining real-time, accurate, reliable, and low-cost multi-source data such as GPS, AFC, and IC can provide data support for travel time prediction. Kalman filter model has high accuracy in one-step prediction and can be used to calculate a large amount of data. This paper adopts the Kalman filter as a travel time prediction model for a single bus based on single-line detection: including the travel time prediction model of route (RTM) and the stop dwell time prediction model (DTM); the evaluation criteria and indexes of the models are given. The error analysis of the prediction results is carried out based on AVL data by case study. Results show that under the precondition of multi-source data, the public transportation prediction model can meet the accuracy requirement for travel time prediction and the prediction effect of the whole route is superior to that of the route segment between stops.

AB We contribute to the understanding of public transport passenger route choice behavior by developing and applying methods that capture behavioral strategies by making use of smart card data. We begin by proposing the classification of possible route choice behavioral strategies in two groups: disaggregated strategies and aggregated strategies. In the former, the alternatives correspond to itineraries, which are fixed sequences of stops and public transport lines. In the latter, common line alternatives are considered, which are combinations of itineraries defined under given criteria. Almost all route choice models use consideration sets composed only of itineraries, while public transport assignment models for strategic analysis mostly use a version of the common lines approach. We postulate that this dichotomy is inappropriate and that, instead, heterogeneity exists in the route choice strategy, both between users and across contexts. With the aim of verifying this hypothesis, we first propose an indicator function constructed as the difference between expected and observed trips for a given behavioral assumption. We apply then the indicator to a case study based on smart card data from the city of Santiago, Chile, from which we find evidence of heterogeneity. We identify individuals that follow either an aggregated or a disaggregated strategy, as well as others who seem to be using a combination of both strategies. We further analyze the heterogeneity hypothesis using an integrated discrete choice and latent class approach, which we apply to the same case study. This approach involves estimating path-size logit models built with alternatives from disaggregated and aggregated strategies, as well as a latent class model built from a combination of both. It also addresses methodological challenges related to the definition of the consideration set and the correction of endogeneity. Results confirm the heterogeneity hypothesis, suggesting that the mean probability that passengers belong to the class that uses a disaggregated strategy for route choice is 51.2%, and that this heterogeneity markedly occurs between individuals, not within their choices. We also find that the latent class considering aggregated alternatives appear to prefer bus over metro, while the latent class considering disaggregated alternatives prefer metro over bus. The fact that waiting time is relatively more burdensome for the aggregated strategy class is in line with this class's preference for common lines. Walking time and bus crowding are more burdensome for the disaggregated strategy class, in line with their observed modal preferences.

AB Transport agencies require accurate and updated information about public transport systems for the optimal decision-making processes regarding design and operation. In addition to assessing topology and service components, users' behaviors must be considered. To this end, a data-driven performance evaluation based on passengers' actual routes is key. Automatic fare collection platforms provide meaningful smart card data (SCD), but these are incomplete when gathered by entry-only systems. To obtain origin-destination (OD) matrices, we must manage complete journeys. In this paper, we use an adapted trip chaining method to reconstruct incomplete multi-modal journeys by finding spatial similarities between the outbound and inbound routes of the same user. From this dataset, we develop a performance evaluation framework that provides novel metrics and visualization utilities. First, we generate a space-time characterization of the overall operation of transport networks. Second, we supply enhanced OD matrices showing mobility patterns between zones and average traversed distances, travel times, and operation speeds, which model the real efficacy of the public transport system. We applied this framework to the Comunidad de Madrid (Spain), using 4 months' worth of real SCD, showing its potential to generate meaningful information about the performance of multi-modal public transport systems.

AB Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has changed travel behaviour and reduced the use of public transport throughout the world, but the reduction has not been uniform. In this study we analyse the propensity to stop travelling by public transport during COVID-19 for the holders of 1.8 million smart cards in Stockholm, Sweden, for the spring and autumn of 2020. We suggest two binomial logit models for explaining the change in travel pattern, linking socioeconomic data per area and travel data with the probability to stop travelling. Modelled variables The first model investigates the impact of the socioeconomic factors: age; income; education level; gender; housing type; population density; country of origin; and employment level. The results show that decreases in public transport use are linked to all these factors. The second model groups the investigated areas into five distinct clusters based on the socioeconomic data, showing the impacts for different socioeconomic groups. During the autumn the differences between the groups diminished, and especially Cluster 1 (with the lowest education levels, lowest income and highest share of immigrants) reduced their public transport use to a similar level as the more affluent clusters. Results The results show that socioeconomic status affect the change in behaviour during the pandemic and that exposure to the virus is determined by citizens' socioeconomic class. Furthermore, the results can guide policy into tailoring public transport supply to where the need is, instead of assuming that e.g. crowding is equally distributed within the public transport system in the event of a pandemic.

AB Capturing unobserved correlation between overlapping routes is a non-trivial problem in route choice modelling. For urban transit networks, research so far has been inconclusive on how this overlap is perceived by travellers. We estimate a series of path size correction logit (PSCL) models to account for alternative specifications of route overlap, including a new definition of overlap in terms of transfer nodes is proposed for multi-leg journeys. Our estimation is performed on smart card data from Amsterdam. The results indicate that the overlap between transit routes is valued positively when incorporated using either link-based, leg-based or transfer node-based PSC individually, with the transfer node-based PSC resulting in the best model fit. When considered simultaneously, the overlap of transfer nodes is valued positively by the travellers, but the subsequent overlap of journey legs is valued negatively, implying that travellers prefer having multiple (distinct) travel options at common transfer locations.

AB The metro has developed rapidly in the past two decades and has become one of the crucial patterns of transportation for urban residents in China. Many studies have explored the factors affecting metro ridership, but few have focused on the metro usage of specific groups, such as the elderly and students. This paper uses the negative binomial regression model to explore the relationship between the built environment and the metro ridership of three types of people (adults, the elderly, and students) by using the metro smart card data of Qingdao. We also used the fractional response model to discuss the factors that influence the ridership share for the elderly and students. The results show that most variables promote the metro usage of the three groups of people but have a significantly different effect on the market share of those groups. Specifically, the number of schools, hospitals, supermarkets, squares, parks, and scenic spots near metro stations significantly increases the proportion of the elderly metro usage. The number of bus stops and schools substantially increases the share of metro ridership by students. The research results can provide valuable insights for promoting the metro's overall ridership and minimizing the gap in allocating public transport resources among different groups.

AB Recently, local governments have been using transportation card data to monitor the use of public transport and improve the service. However, local governments that are applying a single-fare scheme are experiencing difficulties in using data for accurate identification of real travel patterns or policy decision support due to missing information on alighting stops of users. This policy limits its functionality of utilizing data such as accurate identification of real travel patterns, policy decision support, etc. In order to overcome these limitations, various methods for estimating alighting stops have been developed. This study classifies trips with missing alighting stop information into trip four types and then applies appropriate alighting stop estimation methodology for each trip type in stages. The proposed method is evaluated by utilizing transportation card data of the Seoul metropolitan area and checking the accuracy for each standard of allowable error for sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that the stage-by-stage estimation methodology based on the trip type proposed in this study can estimate users' destinations more accurately than the methodologies of previous studies. Furthermore, based on the construction of nearly 100% valid tag data, this study differs from prior studies.

AB Transfers are a major contributor to travel time unreliability for journeys in public transport. Thus, connections between services in the public transport network must be reliable. To plan such reliable transfers from e.g. busses to trains, it is crucial to know the necessary walking times from stops to platforms. This paper presents an innovative approach for estimation of walking time distributions from bus stops to train platforms based on a matching of smart card data and automatic vehicle location data. The observed times from bus stop to rail platform turns out to have a large variance, due to two reasons: differences in passenger walking speeds, and passengers who are doing activities during the transfer. To account for these variations a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model is applied, where the time for passengers walking directly and passengers doing activities during the transfer follows separate distributions. The proposed methodology is applied to 129 stations in the Eastern part of Denmark, where the tap-in devices are located at the train platform. Results from two stations with different characteristics are presented in details along with justifications and analyses of model accuracy. The outcome of the model with distributions of the necessary walking times from bus stops to train platforms is important input for timetabling connections, and the data-driven methodology can easily be applied at scale.

AB COVID-19 has dramatically struck each section of our society: health, economy, employment, and mobility. This work presents a data-driven characterization of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on public and private mobility in a mid-size city in Spain (Fuenlabrada). Our analysis used real data collected from the public transport smart card system and a Bluetooth traffic monitoring network, from February to September 2020, thus covering relevant phases of the pandemic. Our results show that, at the peak of the pandemic, public and private mobility dramatically decreased to 95% and 86% of their pre-COVID-19 values, after which the latter experienced a faster recovery. In addition, our analysis of daily patterns evidenced a clear change in the behavior of users towards mobility during the different phases of the pandemic. Based on these findings, we developed short-term predictors of future public transport demand to provide operators and mobility managers with accurate information to optimize their service and avoid crowded areas. Our prediction model achieved a high performance for pre- and post-state-of-alarm phases. Consequently, this work contributes to enlarging the knowledge about the impact of pandemic on mobility, providing a deep analysis about how it affected each transport mode in a mid-size city.

AB New shared mobility services have become increasingly common in many cities and shown potential to address urban transportation challenges. This study aims to analyze the mobility performance of integrating bike-sharing into multimodal transport systems and develop a machine learning model to predict the performance of intermodal trips with bike-sharing compared with those without bike-sharing for a given trip using transit smart card data and bike-sharing GPS data from the city of Seoul. The results suggest that using bike-sharing in the intermodal trips where it performs better than buses could enhance the mobility performance by providing up to 34% savings in travel time per trip compared with the scenarios in which bus is used exclusively for the trips and up to 33% savings when bike-sharing trips are used exclusively. The results of the machine learning models suggest that the random forest classifier outperformed three other classifiers with an accuracy of 90% in predicting the performance of bike-sharing and intermodal transit trips. Further analysis and applications of the mobility performance of bike-sharing in Seoul are presented and discussed.

AB Uncertainty during the course of a trip is regarded as a particularly disturbing phenomenon by public transport (PT) passengers and has been shown to have a substantial impact on travel behaviour. However, so far there has been little empirical evidence within contemporary research concerning the degree of mid- to long-term adaptation among PT passengers to changes in the principal cause of such uncertainty within PT transport systems: Lack of service departure reliability. While most studies to date have focussed on instantaneous or short-term behavioural responses, this paper presents results from a one-year panel dataset consisting of individuals' trip itineraries derived from smart card transactions enriched by automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. We measured long-term line route usage and departure reliability, the latter in terms of headway regularity and schedule adherence, in two panel waves. Thus, we aimed for practical indicators that may be associated with specific line routes and origin-destination PT stop pairs used for recurring trips over time. Results from logistic regression indicate a consistent significant impact of changed headway regularity and punctuality change for line routes with relatively high departure frequency. However, there is a relative indifference to long-term reliability change by a significant share of individuals that have actual trade-offs between at least two line route options, possibly indicating satisficing behaviour among PT passengers. Implications on PT path choice forecasting and route planning are discussed.

AB Disruptions in public transport are a major source of frustration for passengers and result in lower public transport usage. Previous studies on the effect of disruptions on passenger travel behaviour have mainly focused on shorter disruptions, while the few studies on impacts of long-term disruptions have had limited focus on individual passenger behaviour. This paper fills the gap in research by proposing a novel methodology based on smart card data for analysing the impacts of long-term planned disruptions on passenger travel behaviour. We use k-means clustering to group passengers based on their travel behaviour before and after the closure. We can thus observe how different passenger groups changed travel behaviour after the disruption. We compare these observations to a group of reference lines without disruption to account for general trends. Using hierarchical clustering of daily travel patterns, we are able to in-depth analyse the reactions of certain passenger groups to the disruption. We apply the method on a 3-month closure of a rail line in the Greater Copenhagen area. The results suggest that, in particular, passengers with an everyday commuting behaviour have decreased after the disruption. The proposed methodology enables explicit analysis of the impact of disruptions on diverse passengers segments, while the specific results are useful for public transport agencies when planning long-term maintenance projects.

ID PUBLIC TRANSPORT; TIME
AB Transit accessibility is an explanatory variable evaluating the mobility of a region in consideration of the connectivity and demand among the regions, which has been used for an important index to determine transport policy on the transit network. This study aims to develop an accessibility index considering the two factors with a demand-weighted approach, that is, impedance and attraction level. Two variables, travel time and the ratio of trips, are employed to calculate the accessibility index, and comparative assessments between zones are conducted. The application of smart card data makes it possible to analyze travel information and reflect them empirically in the model. This study identifies zones with vulnerable accessibility and suggests criteria for transit investment plans with two aspects, that is, intensive transit area and spatial distribution of the accessibility index. These aspects contribute to transit planners by suggesting transit investment criteria and comprehensible statistics to evaluate accessibility. Since zones with low accessibility indexes are identified as being vulnerable to access from other zones, policymakers should focus on those zones to improve the overall transit network.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Public transportation agencies call for an intuitive, interactive, and reusable visualization tool to detect patterns of crime (i.e. pickpockets and gangs) or missing commuters on public transportation systems. Few existing visualization techniques have visually explored mobility correlations of targets and their companions, who are characterized in diverse mobility types, by using discrete travel hints extracted from a massive amount of data. To fill this gap, a visual analytical system is provided to conduct a group-based and individual-based exploration of mobility correlations of passengers of interest, based on an auto integration of multiple queries. How passengers differ from or correlate with each other are further examined based on their spatiotemporal distributions in trajectories and ODs. Real-world case studies, as well as user feedback made by 30 participants, demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in detecting specific targets and their companions featured in diverse mobility types, or in characterizing their spatiotemporal aggregation patterns for a further tracking on public transportation systems.

AB Smart card (SC) data has become one of the major data sources for transit passengers' behavior analysis, network modeling, and control optimization. Origin-destination (O-D) estimation has been recognized as a requisite step before utilizing the smart card data to investigate transit passengers' spatiotemporal dynamics or conduct other SC data-based transit modeling. In the recent decade, the extant literature has proposed various trip-chain-based methods for transit O-D estimation using SC data. However, one problem of the conventional trip-chaining estimation approach has been noticed but not paid enough attention to: O-D estimation of single transactions cannot be conducted since the trip-chain method generally requires at least two trip records per day to proceed with. Such a flaw in the classic trip-chain approach might lead to a considerable amount of data loss and inaccurate O-D estimation. This paper improved the existing trip-chain O-D estimation method by introducing a new framework based on the Minimum Entropy Rate (MER) criterion. The proposed MER-based method adopts a similar mechanism of noise reduction in information theory. The basic idea of our approach is to infer the alighting location of single trips using alternative stops that preserve passengers' travel regularity exhibiting in their mobility sequences. Our enhanced approach can estimate alighting stops for single trips with decent accuracy, thus preventing a potential massive data loss. Moreover, the study also provides an in-depth insight into the relationship between entropy rates estimated using trip sequences and passengers' travel regularity. The estimation results can further benefit future transit studies with reliable data sources.

AB In this paper, we investigate the influence of train headways on passenger platform wait times using automated data from the London Underground metro system. For high frequency services, the literature suggests that passenger arrivals are random and that under perfectly random conditions with all other factors held constant, wait times are equivalent to half of the headway between trains. We test this hypothesis using large-scale smart card and vehicle location data, which enables the extraction of access times from total passenger journey times as well as the precise measurement of train headways. Using a semiparametric regression modelling framework, we generate non-linear estimates of the relationship between access times and headway while conditioning for other service supply and demand factors. Marginal platform wait times are then derived numerically via an exposure-response model framework which accounts for potential confounding between the walking and waiting components of access times, thus enabling quantification of the unbiased impact of headways on wait times. For three lines in central London, we observe that marginal wait times transition from greater than half of the headway to approximately one third of the headway as train frequencies decrease. The transition occurs in the range between 2-3 min headways, lower than earlier estimates in the literature. A series of numerical simulations illustrate the importance of waiting time sensitivity in the optimisation of public transport services. In comparison with the standard wait time assumption, our exercise reveals that the degree of density economies is milder than what the literature suggests, and this may neutralise some of the economic justifications of high public transport subsidies.

AB The changes in public transport ridership can be quantified as fare elasticities that are useful inputs to inform planning and policymaking, particularly for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in developing city contexts. This research provides new evidence to the limited literature in the Global South about revealed preferences fare elasticity from disaggregated data and improves our knowledge of BRT passengers' travel behavior providing insights on the important role of achieving an affordable fare. Using a 9-year smartcard data, we show that in a spatially segregated city, such as Bogota, the BRT fare has differential effects according to the socio-economic characteristics of its users and the time-of-the-day. To estimate the fare elasticity considering the socio-economic heterogeneity of users, we proposed a clustering algorithm based on the stationdemand profiles and an indicative average per capita income associated with the station catchment area. The results show significant statistical differences in elasticities between the three identified clusters. The stations located in the urban periphery, associated with low-income areas, show null or low response to the fare changes, as opposed to the stations located on the east edge of the city (wealthiest zones). These findings show that a flat fare in the BRT system has differential fare effects on users, therefore, considering those differences when designing the fare policy scheme would contribute to starting to close accessibility gaps in the city.

AB Smart card data has emerged in recent years and provide a comprehensive, and cheap source of information for planning and managing public transport systems. This paper presents a multi-stage machine learning framework to predict passengers' boarding stops using smart card data. The framework addresses the challenges arising from the imbalanced nature of the data (e.g. many non-travelling data) and the 'many-class' issues (e.g. many possible boarding stops) by decomposing the prediction of hourly ridership into three stages: whether to travel or not in that one-hour time slot, which bus line to use, and at which stop to board. A simple neural network architecture, fully connected networks (FCN), and two deep learning architectures, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) are implemented. The proposed approach is applied to a real-life bus network. We show that the data imbalance has a profound impact on the accuracy of prediction at individual level. At aggregated level, FCN is able to accurately predict the rideship at individual stops, it is poor at capturing the temporal distribution of ridership. RNN and LSTM are able to measure the temporal distribution but lack the ability to capture the spatial distribution through bus lines.

AB Origin-destination travel demand matrix is the signature of travel dynamics in transportation networks. Many fundamental analyses of transportation systems rely on the origin-destination demand matrix of the network. Although extraction of origin-destination travel demand for public transportation networks from ticketing data is not a new problem, yet it entails challenges, such as 'alighting transaction inference' and 'transfer identification' which are worthy of further attention. This is mainly because the state-of-the-art solutions to these challenges, are often heavily reliant on network-specific expert knowledge and extensive parameter setting, or multiple data sources. In this paper, we propose a procedure that effectively applies statistical pattern recognition techniques to address the main challenges in extracting the origin-destination demand from passenger smartcard records. Learning from patterns in the available data allows the procedure to perform well under minimum case-specific assumptions, thus it becomes applicable to smartcard data from various public transportation systems. The performance of the proposed framework is tested on a dataset of over 100 million smartcard transaction records from Melbourne's multi-modal public transportation network. Evaluations on different aspects of the proposed procedure, suggest that the identified tasks are well addressed, and the framework is able to extract an accurate estimation of the origin-destination demand matrix for the system.

TI Estimating Express Train Preference of Urban Railway Passengers Based on

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID CHOICE; OPERATION; SMOTE; BUS
AB As the share of public transport increases, the express strategy of the urban railway is regarded as one of the solutions that allow the public transportation system to operate efficiently. It is crucial to express the urban railway's express strategy to balance a passenger load between the two types of trains, that is, local and express trains. This research aims to estimate passengers' preference between local and express trains based on a machine learning technique. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is trained to model express train preference using smart card and train log data. The passengers are categorized into four types according to their preference for the local and express trains. The smart card data and train log data of Metro Line 9 in Seoul are combined to generate the individual trip chain alternatives for each passenger. With the dataset, the train preference is estimated by XGBoost, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is used to interpret and analyze the importance of individual features. The overall F1 score of the model is estimated to be 0.982. The results of feature analysis show that the total travel time of the local train feature is found to substantially affect the probability of express train preference with a 1.871 SHAP value. As a result, the probability of the express train preference increases with longer total travel time, shorter in-vehicle time, shorter waiting time, and few transfers on the passenger's route. The model shows notable performance in accuracy and provided an understanding of the estimation results.

AB Detecting urban mobility structure, i.e., segmenting urban areas into disjoint clusters with similar mobility patterns, can facilitate our understanding of how a city is organized and how different parts of a city interact with each other, which underpin informed decision-making in achieving sustainable urban transportation development and resilient society. In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management.

AB Existing public transport (PT) planning methods use a trip-based approach, rather than a user-based approach, leading to neglecting equity. In other words, the impacts of regular users-i.e., users with higher trip rates-are overrepresented during analysis and modelling because of higher trip rates. In contrast to the existing studies, this study aims to show the actual demand characteristic and users' share are different in daily and monthly data. For this, 1-month of smart card data from the Kocaeli, Turkey, was evaluated by means of specific variables, such as boarding frequency, cardholder types, and the number of users, as well as a breakdown of the number of days traveled by each user set. Results show that the proportion of regular PT users to total users in 1 workday, is higher than the monthly proportion of regular PT users to total users. Accordingly, users who have 16-21 days boarding frequency are 16% of the total users, and yet they have been overrepresented by 39% in the 1-day analysis. Moreover, users who have 1-6 days boarding frequency, have a share of 66% in the 1-month dataset and are underrepresented with a share of 22% in the 1-day analysis. Results indicated that the daily travel data without information related to the day-to-day frequency of trips and PT use caused incorrect estimation of real PT demand. Moreover, user-based analyzing approach over a month prepares the more realistic basis for transportation planning, design, and prioritization of transport investments.

AB Understanding public transport usage by older adults is necessary to develop senior-friendly public transport and improve the mobility of older persons. Although extensive literature has examined the travel patterns of older adults, very limited efforts have been invested to explore the longitudinal variability in public transport usage by different age groups of older adults. To address this limitation, we developed user-monthly profiles to explore the seasonal variability in public transport usage by older adults and defined user-based time slots of the day and geographical user areas to represent daily trip patterns and examine day-to-day variability. Using one-year smart card transaction data and an anonymous cardholder database from Shizuoka, Japan, we evaluated the seasonal and day-to-day variability in public transport usage by older adults. We also analyzed the role of age and living environment in travel pattern variability. The results indicate that older adults in highly developed areas and younger-old group (aged 65-74) are more likely to be characterized by high-frequency public transport usage and low seasonal variability. Additionally, the day-to-day variability in public transport usage by older adults is greater in more developed areas and appears to increase with age. This study enhances our understanding of public transport usage by older adults, which may contribute to the development of senior-friendly public transport policies and services.

AB Many public transport networks worldwide experience high crowding levels. Overcrowding can result in passengers not able to board the first arriving vehicle. We infer how waiting time induced by being denied boarding in crowded public transport systems is valued by passengers, based on observed passenger route choice behaviour. For this purpose, we estimate a revealed preference route choice model based on passenger and vehicle movement data. As denied boarding typically occurs only at specific locations and within strict time bands, whilst its occurrence is notoriously uncertain, we propose additional constraints to generate an appropriate choice set for which observed route choices can be used to estimate denied boarding perceptions. We found that the additional waiting time caused by denied boarding is valued 68% more negatively compared to the initial waiting time. On average, one minute of initial and denied boarding wait time are perceived as 1.62 and 2.72 min on-board an uncrowded vehicle, respectively. Not incorporating this more negative denied boarding wait time valuation can result in an underestimation of the passenger and societal impact of overcrowding in public transport systems. Moreover, it can underestimate the benefits of potential crowding relief measures and as such underestimate the benefit-cost ratio of these measures.

AB The measurement of medical service accessibility is typically based on driving or Euclidean distance. However, in most non-emergency cases, public transport is the travel mode used by the public to access medical services. Yet, there has been little evaluation of the public transport system-based inequality of medical service accessibility. This work uses massive real smart card data (SCD) and an improved potential model to estimate the public transport-based medical service accessibility in Beijing, China. These real SCD data are used to calculate travel costs in terms of time and distance, and medical service accessibility is estimated using an improved potential model. The spatiotemporal variations and patterns of medical service accessibility are explored, and the results show that it is unevenly spatiotemporally distributed across the study area. For example, medical service accessibility in urban areas is higher than that in suburban areas, accessibility during peak periods is higher than that during off-peak periods, and accessibility on weekends is generally higher than that on weekdays. To explore the association of medical service accessibility with socio-economic factors, the relationship between accessibility and house price is investigated via a spatial econometric analysis. The results show that, at a global level, house price is positively correlated with medical service accessibility. In particular, the medical service accessibility of a higher-priced spatial housing unit is lower than that of its neighboring spatial units, owing to the positive spatial spillover effect of house price. This work sheds new light on the inequality of medical service accessibility from the perspective of public transport, which may benefit urban policymakers and planners.

AB Circuity of transit networks, defined as the ratio of network to Euclidean distance traveled from origin to destination stop, has been known to influence travel behavior. In addition to the longer time spent in travel, for networks where fare is based on distance traveled, higher circuity also means higher fare for the same Euclidean distance. This makes circuity relevant from an equity perspective. Using a case study of the urban transit network of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, this study explores the role of transit circuity on the disparity in distance traveled by travelers? income profile and its implications on travel times and costs for networks with distance based fares. The analysis is based on travel patterns from smart card data for bus, tram, and metro modes, combined with neighborhood level income data. Results reveal that in Amsterdam, the higher the share of high income people living in proximity to a transit stop, the lower the circuity of journeys from the stop, when controlled for the Euclidean distance covered and spatial auto-correlation. The uneven distribution of circuity exacerbates the disparity in distance traveled, and hence fare paid between the income groups. However, the travel time per Euclidean distance favors the low income group, possibly due to the circuitous routes serving these areas being compensated by higher travel speeds. This study highlights the role of transit network design in determining its equity outcomes and emphasizes the importance of considering equity during route and fare planning. The process followed can be adapted to examine equity for other urban networks.

AB COVID-19 threatens the world. Social distancing is a significant factor in determining the spread of this disease, and social distancing is strongly affected by the local travel behaviour of people in large cities. In this study, we analysed the changes in the local travel behaviour of various population groups in Hong Kong, between 1 January and 31 March 2020, by using second-by-second smartcard data obtained from the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) system. Due to the pandemic, local travel volume decreased by 43%, 49% and 59% during weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays, respectively. The local travel volumes of adults, children, students and senior citizens decreased by 42%, 86%, 73% and 48%, respectively. The local travel behaviour changes for adults and seniors between non-pandemic and pandemic times were greater than those between weekdays and weekends. The opposite was true for children and students. During the pandemic, the daily commute flow decreased by 42%. Local trips to shopping areas, amusement areas and borders decreased by 42%, 81% and 99%, respectively. The effective reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 had the strongest association with daily population use of the MTR 7?8 days earlier.

TI Equity of public transport costs before and after a fare policy reform:
   An empirical evaluation using smartcard data
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article

   Australia
AB Smartcard-based public transit systems have been widely adopted across many cities around the world. These systems generate large volumes of transaction records from individual passenger trips and contain the requisite information that enable the mapping, measurement and monitoring of fare equity. In this paper, we propose and apply new measures to evaluate fare equity using smartcard data to map changes in fare equities following a fare policy reform across a major metropolitan region in Australia. Smartcard data is used to first reconstruct individual travel trajectories on which we compute our measures to explore two dimensions of equity: (1) 'horizontal' (for all passengers) versus 'vertical' (different types of passengers); and, (2) 'global' (across the entire transit network) versus 'local' (for a specific travel zone). Results reveal that in the first dimension the fare policy reform led to more equitable fares with the effect of diminishing spatial variations under the old policy for all types of transit passengers (adults, children, seniors and concession card holders); however, the impact of this fare policy reform reflected in the second dimension is subject to the number of zones travelled, residential location of passengers, the number of journeys made within the week and the applicable incentives. Finally, we draw on our empirical approach to report on a prototype dashboard through which public transit agencies have the capacity to map, measure and monitor how ridership translates to fare equities. More generally, we highlight the capacity of smartcard data, when embedded within our empirical framework, to better inform smarter policy around fare reforms in order to achieve greater equity across service populations.

AB With recent developments in ICT, the interest in using large amounts of accumulated data for traffic policy planning has increased significantly. In recent years, data polishing has been proposed as a new method of big data analysis. Data polishing is a graphical clustering method, which can be used to extract patterns that are similar or related to each other by identifying the cluster structures present in the data. The purpose of this study is to identify the travel patterns of railway passengers by applying data polishing to smart card data collected in the Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. To this end, we consider 9,008,709 data points collected over a period of 15 months, ranging from December 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2015. This dataset includes various types of information, including trip histories and types of passengers. This study implements data polishing to cluster 4,667,520 combinations of information regarding individual rides in terms of the day of the week, the time of the day, passenger types, and origin and destination stations. Via the analysis, 127 characteristic travel patterns are identified in aggregate.

The data are structured; and then corrected and completed utilizing several criteria, including a probabilistic approach based on the distributions of travel and dwell times, aiming to minimize the distortions that appear due to the nature of the available sources. The case study data encompass one year of records from the automated vehicle location, fare collection, and scheduling subsystems in Santander City, Spain. The results are discussed with captures from an interactive web visualization tool that has been developed for this work.

AB Smart card data from the Automatic Fare Collecting systems (AFC) and timetable information, such as Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), are used in combination by practitioners and researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the public transit network. In some cases, AVL data are not available due to records being missing in the system. In such cases, people resort to the used schedule timetable such as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) to match smart card data to the transit network. Since delays or changes to the timetable are not contained in the scheduled timetable, it can result in wrong matches between the smart card data and the transit network. This paper shows how the uncertainty of arrival and departure times affects passengers to train assignments and proposes a method for estimating the missing arrival time of trains when the recorded timetable information is not available. The method uses the knowledge of how the tap-outs are distributed in a hierarchical, latent Bayesian model to predict the arrival times of trains. Evaluated on 15,136 train arrivals, the model can infer 70% of the arrivals times with an average error of 28 to 32 seconds depending on the station.

AB Understanding the travel behaviors and activity patterns of vulnerable people is important for addressing social equity in urban and transportation planning. With the increasing availability of large-scale individual tracking data, new opportunities have emerged for studying people's travel behaviors and activity patterns. However, the data has not been fully exploited to examine the travel characteristics of vulnerable people and their implications for understanding transport-related disadvantage. This study proposes a methodological framework based on the concept of activity space that enables a comprehensive examination of vulnerable people's spatiotemporal travel characteristics and an investigation of the geographies of transport disadvantage. Using the proposed framework, a case study that investigates the bus activities of the vulnerable population using four-month smart card data is carried out in the city of Wuhu, China. The case study suggests that vulnerable people possess distinct travel behaviors that differ considerably from the mainstream population and that the implications of transport disadvantage, as revealed by the participation in bus activities, vary across different demographic groups and across different spatial contexts. Some of the empirical insights obtained from this study also differ from conclusions drawn from previous studies and will enrich our understandings of vulnerable people's activities. Overall, the paper makes two major contributions. Methodologically, the proposed framework can overcome some of the deficiencies of activity space-based approaches for understanding transport disadvantage and contribute broadly to the studies of travel behaviors and activities patterns using individual-level tracking data. Empirically, the study identifies varying spatial and temporal implications of transport disadvantage associated with different vulnerable groups, which could further shed light on public transit planning and service design.

AB For a sustainable public transport system, it is important to unveil the spatiotemporal characteristics of ridership and identify the influence mechanisms. Some studies analysed the effects of weather and built environment separately, however, their effects when incorporated remains to be determined. Using smart card data, weather information, and point of interest data from Beijing, the Light Gradient Boosted Machine was employed to investigate the relative importance of weather and built environment variables contributing to daily ridership at the traffic analysis zone level, and investigate the non-linear relationship and interaction effects between them. Weather conditions and built environment contribute 30.22 and 55.83% to ridership fluctuations, respectively. Most variables show complex non-linear and threshold effects on ridership. The interaction effects of weather and weekend/public holiday have a more substantial influence on ridership than weekdays, indicating weather conditions have less impact on regular commuting trips than discretionary trips. The ridership fluctuations in response to changing weather conditions vary with spatial locations. Adverse weather, such as strong wind, high humidity, or heavy rainfall, has a more disruptive impact on leisure-related areas than on residence and office areas. This study can benefit stakeholders in making decisions about optimising public transport networks and scheduling service frequency.

AB The north-south metro line in Amsterdam became operational in summer 2018, accompanied by changes to the existing bus, metro, and tram network in the city. In this paper we undertake an ex-post analysis of the transportation impacts of the network change. Using two sets of smart card transactions, of 5-6 weeks each, and corresponding Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data, a before-after comparison is made, concerning ridership, travel times, number of transfers, and travel time reliability. The results show a 4% increase in network wide working day ridership and a strong shift from tram and bus to metro. On an average working day, more than 6,000 hours of travel time is saved. 21% of travellers have more than 1 minute shorter travel time and 13% of travellers have more than 1 minute travel time increase. Furthermore, slightly fewer transfers are made, and the aggregated effect on travel time reliability is marginally positive. For an average working day (7am to 7pm), the resulting daily societal benefits of the new public transport network are approximately (SIC)54,200. On a yearly basis the transport related societal benefits are approximately 22 million euros. Doing an ex-post analysis is not common in the literature and in practice, and therefore in a lot of cases the realized benefits of large infrastructural investments remain unknown. This study provides an example of scientific methodology development using multiple data sources, that enables such ex-post evaluations, leading to improvements in public transport assessment and planning.

DE Personalised smart card data; transport planning; latent Dirichlet
   allocation modelling; travel pattern analysis; geodemographics
AB Plentiful studies have discussed the potential applications of contactless smart card from understanding interchange patterns to transit network analysis and user classifications. However, the incomplete and anonymous nature of the smart card data inherently limit the interpretations and understanding of the findings, which further limit planning implementations. Geodemographics, as 'an analysis of people by where they live', can be utilised as a promising supplement to provide contextual information to transport planning. This paper develops a methodological framework that conjointly integrates personalised smart card data with open geodemographics so as to pursue a better understanding of the traveller's behaviours. It adopts a text mining technology, latent Dirichlet allocation modelling, to extract the transit patterns from the personalised smart card data and then use the open geodemographics derived from census data to enhance the interpretation of the patterns. Moreover, it presents night tube as an example to illustrate its potential usefulness in public transport planning.

TI A Network-Based Model of Passenger Transfer Flow between Bus and Metro:
   An Application to the Public Transport System of Beijing
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

   LONDON; ROUTE; TIME
AB In a multimodal public transport network, transfers are inevitable. Planning and managing an efficient transfer connection is thus important and requires an understanding of the factors that influence those transfers. Existing studies on predicting passenger transfer flows have mainly used transit assignment models based on route choice, which need extensive computation and underlying behavioral assumptions. Inspired by studies that use network properties to estimate public transport (PT) demand, this paper proposes to use the network properties of a multimodal PT system to explain transfer flows. A statistical model is estimated to identify the relationship between transfer flow and the network properties in a joint bus and metro network. Apart from transfer time, the number of stops, and bus lines, the most important network property we propose in this study is transfer accessibility. Transfer accessibility is a newly defined indicator for the geographic factors contributing to the possibility of transferring at a station, given its position in a multimodal PT network, based on an adapted gravity-based measure. It assumes that transfer accessibility at each station is proportional to the number of reachable points of interest within the network and dependent on a cost function describing the effect of distance. The R-squared of the regression model we propose is 0.69, based on the smart card data, PT network data, and Points of Interest (POIs) data from the city of Beijing, China. This suggests that the model could offer some decision support for PT planners especially when complex network assignment models are too computationally intensive to calibrate and use.

AB Traditional customized buses travel on fixed routes, which cannot satisfy passengers' flexibility and convenience requirements. This paper studies a demand-responsive transit (DRT) service that can continuously adjust the path based on passengers' dynamic demand. The path optimization model is established with more realistic constraints to create a bus travel plan within a specified area, and the model not only considers the preferred time windows of passengers but also maximizes the benefits of the system. Based on simulated annealing, a dynamic genetic algorithm is designed to generate the static initial travel path, and the dynamic travel path is continuously updated to satisfy the real-time demand. To evaluate the proposed model and algorithm, a case study in a typical residential community of Beijing, China, is conducted based on transit smart card records. According to the case study results, the convenience, travel time, and economic and environmental benefits of the DRT service are assessed via comparison with traditional buses and private cars. The analysis results demonstrate the feasibility and significance of the method, and it can be used by transit planners to design a superior DRT service. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Estimating the route choice patterns for transit passengers is important to improve service reliability. The size and composition of a route choice set affects the choice model estimation and passenger flow calculations for urban rail transit (URT) networks. With the existing threshold decision method, there will be omissions or excess routes in the generated route set, which lead to a significant deviation in passenger flow assignments. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to calibrate the travel time thresholds when generating reasonable route choice sets. First, an automatic fare collection (AFC) data-driven framework is established to more accurately calibrate and dynamically update travel time thresholds with changes in the URT system. The framework consists of four steps: data preprocessing, origin-destination-based threshold calculation, cluster analysis-based calibration, and calibrated result output and update. Second, the proposed approach is applied to the Beijing subway as a case study, and several promising results are analyzed that allow the optimization of existing travel time thresholds. The obtained results help in the estimation of route choice behavior to validate current rail transit assignment models. This study is also applicable for other rail transit networks with AFC systems to record passenger passage times at both entry and exit gates.

AB This study employs an administrative dataset containing high-frequency transaction records for approximately four million smart transit cards used by Singaporean residents in order to study the travel preferences of public transport commuters. We examine the impact of service attributes, including travel time, reliability and travel cost, on commuters' transportation mode choices and estimate the implied value of travel time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR) for different types of public transit commuters. The results show significant heterogeneity in the transport preferences of commuters, with adult transit commuters having higher VOT and VOR relative to senior citizens, students and children. Within the adult group, commuters who frequently switch their transportation modes have significantly higher VOT and VOR. These results have important implications for policymakers in formulating strategies to improve the efficiency of the public transport system, and having flexible and customized transport services could increase the utility and satisfaction levels of public transit commuters.

AB In this paper, we proposed a new method to extract travel patterns for transit riders from different public transportation systems based on temporal motif, which is an emerging notion in network science literature. We then developed a scalable algorithm to recognize temporal motifs from daily trip sub-sequences extracted from two smart card datasets. Our method shows its benefits in uncovering the potential correlation between varying topologies of trip combinations and specific activity chains. Commuting, different types of transfer, and other travel behaviors have been identified. Besides, varying travel-activity chains like "Home -> Work -> Post-work activity (for dining or shopping)-> Back home" and the corresponding travel motifs have been distinguished by incorporating the land use information in the GIS data. The analysis results contribute to our understanding of transit riders' travel behavior. We also present application examples of the travel motif to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach. Our methodology can be adapted to travel pattern analysis using different data sources and lay the foundation for other travel-pattern related studies.

AB Data collected through smart travel cards in public transport networks have become a valuable source of information for transport geography studies. During the last two decades, a growing body of literature has used this sort of data source to study the behaviour of public transport users in cities and regions around the world. However, its use has been scarce in contexts where public transport demand is highly influenced by the activities of the tourist sector. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these data can be leveraged to optimize the supply of public transport. In this article, data drawn from the Camp de Tarragona automated fare collection system extracted during 2018 are used to study tourists' use of public transport in Costa Daurada (Catalonia, Spain). This is a popular coastal destination with a high concentration of visitors during the summer period. The analysis focuses on the use of the T-10, a multipersonal transport fare with no time limitations on its use which makes it appealing for tourists. Model-based clustering has been applied to identify different clusters of passengers according to their activity and spatial profiles. Differences between profiles are significant and, as a result, this study allowed the validation of a method that could be replicated in other contexts, as it provides highly useful information for public transport policy and mobility management.

ID MODEL
AB Geodemographics, providing the information of population's characteristics in the regions on a geographical basis, is of immense importance in urban studies, public policy-making, social research and business, among others. Such data, however, are difficult to collect from the public, which is usually done via census, with a low update frequency. In urban areas, with the increasing prevalence of public transit equipped with automated fare payment systems, researchers can collect massive transit smart card (SC) data from a large population. The SC data record human daily activities at an individual level with high spatial and temporal resolutions. It can reveal frequent activity areas (e.g., residential areas) and travel behaviours of passengers that are intimately intertwined with personal interests and characteristics. This provides new opportunities for geodemographic study. This paper seeks to develop a framework to infer travellers' demographics (such as age, income level and car ownership, et al.) and their residential areas for geodemographic mapping using SC data with a household survey. We first use a decision tree diagram to detect passengers' residential areas. We then represent each individual's spatio-temporal activity pattern derived from multi-week SC data as a 2D image. Leveraging this representation, a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to predict multiple demographics of individuals from the images. Combing the demographics and locations of their residence, geodemographic information is further obtained. The methodology is applied to a large-scale SC dataset provided by Transport for London. Results provide new insights in understanding the relationship between human activity patterns and demographics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to infer geodemographics by using the SC data.

AB Facilitated by rapid development of the data-intensive techniques together with communication and sensing technology, we can take advantage of smart card data collected through Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems to establish connections between public transit and urban spatial structure. In this paper, with a case study on Shenzhen metro system in China, we investigate the agglomeration pattern of passenger flow among subway stations. Specifically, leveraging inbound and outbound passenger flows at subway stations, we propose a clustering refinement approach based on cluster member stability among multiple clusterings produced by isomorphic or heterogeneous clusterers. Furthermore, we validate and elaborate five clusters of subway stations in terms of regional functionality and urban planning by comparing station clusters with reference to government planning policies and regulations of Shenzhen city. Additionally, outlier stations with ambiguous functionalities are detected using proposed clustering refinement framework.

AB Although both public transport and private modes have their own purposes and safety issues, most people are free to choose either way to make a trip. Previous research states that increasing the mode share of public transport is an important transportation policy to improve traffic safety, and it is a key outcome of demand management indeed. However, rather than merely focusing on increasing its ridership, a more reliable way to reach for the universality of a public transport system is through its customer retention tendency. Research on satisfaction with bus service often focuses on the influence of specific variables. However, numerous variables may influence users' decision-making. To ease their work, managers have no choice but to ignore some unknown variables. Therefore, we now propose a bottom-up procedure, which needs only smart card data, to obtain the odds ratio of usage of a specific bus route. Logistic regression models are calibrated based on four behavior groups, and the significant coefficients of route variables represent the odds ratios of the bus route usage. The calibration of odds ratio does not need any individual personal or individual socio-economical information, but only smart card transaction data. This method will dramatically decrease the cost and time for data collection. Further, the procedure proposed in this study can be encapsulated in software, which managers can then use to assist their planning. (C) 2019 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences.

AB Understanding travel behavior decisions is a fundamental aim of transportation planning. However, data from surveys or travel diaries that were traditionally used for travel mode-choice modeling are costly and have certain inaccuracies and cover limited populations. Therefore, recently, smart card data collected from automated fare collection systems have gradually become more popular for travel behavior analysis and modeling, but relatively little attention has been paid to investigating the daily variability in travel behavior decisions using more than 1-year smart card data, apart for some descriptive studies. In this study, mode-choice behaviors in public transit were investigated in Seoul using 20-month smart card data to investigate the daily variability in the ratio of the number of subway passengers depending on origin and destination. For this aim, the effects of temporal features such as weather and calendar events as well as the route information and built environments of origin and destination stations were considered on a daily basis for different time periods. To overcome the limitation that the purpose of travel cannot be identified from smart card data, this study attempted to precisely estimate subway connections and extract travel records for commuting from regular commuters' cards. The models were trained using 1-year data and were validated using 8-month data, which verified that the selected factors explain the daily variability in mode-choice behaviors for public transportation.

AB Although automatically collected human travel records can accurately capture the time and location of human movements, they do not directly explain the hidden semantic structures behind the data, e.g., activity types. This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activitytravel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.

AB Effective public transit planning needs to address realistic travel demands, which can be illustrated by corridors across major residential areas and activity centers. It is vital to identify public transit corridors that contain the most significant transit travel demand patterns. We propose a two-stage approach to discover primary public transit corridors at high spatio-temporal resolutions using massive real-world smart card and bus trajectory data, which manifest rich transit demand patterns over space and time. The first stage was to reconstruct chained trips for individual passengers using multi-source massive public transit data. In the second stage, a shared-flow clustering algorithm was developed to identify public transit corridors based on reconstructed individual transit trips. The proposed approach was evaluated using transit data collected in Shenzhen, China. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach is a practical tool for extracting time-varying corridors for many potential applications, such as transit planning and management.

AB The heavy commuting burden borne by disadvantaged individuals and neighbourhoods is a key concern with regard to transport equity. Agreement on the best approach for addressing this problem has been elusive, however, and the existing literature is dominated by traditional survey approaches, which are liable to criticism for small sample sizes, especially when used in studies of megacities (those with populations exceeding 10 million). The aim of the present study was to help fill this gap in the literature by exploring commuting inequity and its determinants using big-data analytics, with Shanghai serving as a case study. A number of 81 million trips from 28 million transit smart cards in 2015 are analzyed. We found the top 20% of commuters in Shanghai, who accounted for about 78,000 of the cardholders, spent more than 60 min commuting each way daily. The results of a geographically weighted regression show that disadvantaged areas characterised by low rent or poor job accessibility tended to be inhabited by especially large numbers of workers with long commutes. Such commuters face a trade-off between housing and travel costs But interestingly, the areas with larger migrant populations have less long commuters. It suggests the development of sprawling housing and industrial areas and informal housing and economic sectors in the suburbs may have the benefit of enhancing the match between jobs and housing for the low-income migrants. Apart from providing more public transit services, inclusive transport policy in growing megacities should also pay more attention to individual people's capability to use the transport services.

AB Bike-sharing systems have rapidly expanded around the world. Previous studies found that docked and dockless bike-sharing systems are different in terms of user demand and travel characteristics. However, their usage regularity and its determinants have not been fully understood. This research aims to fill this gap by exploring smart card data of a docked bike-sharing scheme and GPS trajectory data of a dockless bike-sharing scheme in Nanjing, China, over the same period. Both docked and dockless bike-sharing users can be classified into regular users and occasional users according to their usage frequency. Two systems are cross-compared regarding their travel characteristics. Then, binary logistic models are applied to reveal the impacts of travel characteristics and built environment factors on the regularity of bike-sharing usage. Results show that for both bike-sharing systems, regular users and occasional users share similar riding time and distance, while significant differences in the spatio-temporal distribution between docked and dockless bike-sharing systems are observed. The regression model results show that the "Trips during morning and afternoon peak hours" are positively associated with the regularity of both docked and dockless bike-sharing usage. However, the "Riding distance" variable is negatively associated with the usage regularity of both systems. Built environment factors including working point of interest (POI), residential POI, and transit POI promote the usage regularity of both bike-sharing systems. Finally, policy implications are proposed, such as increasing the density of docking stations in suburban areas and developing high-quality parking area for dockless bike-sharing around public transport stations. This study can help operators or governments to launch or improve the service of bike-sharing systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accessibility metrics are gaining momentum in public transportation planning and policy-making. However, critical user experience issues such as crowding discomfort and travel time unreliability are still not considered in those accessibility indicators. This paper aims to apply a methodology to build spatiotemporal crowding data and estimate travel time variability in a congested public transport network to improve accessibility calculations. It relies on using multiple big data sources available in most transit systems such as smart card and automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. Sao Paulo, Brazil, is used as a case study to show the impact of crowding and travel time variability on accessibility to jobs. Our results evidence a population-weighted average reduction of 56.8% in accessibility to jobs in a regular workday morning peak due to crowding discomfort, as well as reductions of 6.2% due to travel time unreliability and 59.2% when both are combined. The findings of this study can be of invaluable help to public transport planners and policymakers, as they show the importance of including both aspects in accessibility indicators for better decision making. Despite some limitations due to data quality and consistency throughout the study period, the proposed approach offers a new way to leverage big data in public transport to enhance policy decisions.

AB Very few studies have examined the impact of built environment on urban rail transit ridership at the station-to-station (origin-destination) level. Moreover, most direct ridership models (DRMs) tend to involve simple a prior assumed linear or log-linear relationship in which the estimated parameters are assumed to hold across the entire data space of the explanatory variables. These models cannot detect any changes in the linear (or non-linear) effects across different values of the features of built environment on urban rail transit ridership, which possibly induces biased results and hides some non-negligible and detailed information. Based on these research gaps, this study develops a time-of-day origin-destination DRM that uses smart card data pertaining to the Nanjing metro system, China. It applies a gradient boosting regression trees model to provide a more refined data mining approach to investigate the non-linear associations between features of the built environment and station-to-station ridership. Data related to the built environment, station type, demographics, and travel impedance including a less used variable - detour, were collected and used in the analysis. The empirical results show that most independent variables are associated with station-to-station ridership in a discontinuous non-linear way, regardless of the time period. The built environment on the origin side has a larger effect on station-to-station ridership than the built environment on the destination side for the morning peak hours, while the opposite holds for the afternoon peak hours and night. The results also indicate that transfer times is more important variables than detour and route distance.

AB Travel smart cards record passengers' travel histories, which makes it possible to study personal traveling behaviors and passengers' mobility patterns. The existing researches on smart card data pay less attention to those who beg, steal or busk during traveling, and they are called irregular passengers in this paper. Moreover, the group consisted of irregular passengers is called irregular travel group. In this paper, we propose an approach to recognize irregular travel groups based on cascade clustering. Firstly, passengers' travel sequences of active state in hours are extracted as representations of travel patterns according to the records of smart cards in a continuous time period. The sequences are clustered with the K-means algorithm to detect irregular passengers. Then, travel similarities between the derived irregular passengers are measured and irregular travel groups are recognized based on DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. The proposed method is applied to real Beijing subway smart card data, and the results are validated with the data derived from SINA Micro-blogs. Experimental results show that the detected irregular passengers' movement areas are consistent with the ground truth.

AB Public transport origin-destination (OD) estimation based on smartcard data has increasingly been used for transit network planning, passengers' behaviour analyses and network demand forecasting. While various OD estimation methods using the trip-chaining approach have been developed in recent years, the validity of these estimation methods has not extensively been investigated. This study examines the errors in OD estimation caused by inaccurate inference of alighting stops, to improve the accuracy of the existing trip-chaining algorithms. The distribution of errors is evaluated both at the stop level and the public transport zonal level, given the geographical attributes of each zone and the attributes of the smartcard transactions. While the results show significant associations between zone attributes as well as transaction attributes and the alighting stop inference errors, they undermine the existing algorithm's assumption that 'travellers alight a public transport service at a stop which is the closest to their next boarding stop'. Accordingly, this study proposes and evaluates the application of a probabilistic approach using neural networks to infer alighting stops based on a combination of transactional and public transit network attributes. The proposed method is validated using 138,122 smartcard transactions obtained during a normal day in Southeast Queensland, Australia. The results show that our method can improve the accuracy of the existing algorithm by inferring the exact location of 79.5% of the alighting stops and reducing the mean alighting estimation error from 1689 to 503 m for incorrectly estimated alighting stops. At the zonal level, the proposed method also improves the accuracy of the existing algorithm by more than 5%. Finally, the study provides both researchers and practitioners with a method to improve the accuracy of the trip-chaining algorithm and OD estimation, and presents a list of practical guidelines for more effective planning and operation of public transit services.

AB Alleviating public traffic congestion is an efficient and effective way to improve the travel time reliability and quality of public transport services. The existing public network optimization models usually ignored the essential impact of public traffic congestion on the performance of public transport service. To address this problem, this study proposes a data-based methodology to estimate the traffic congestion of road segments between bus stops (RSBs). The proposed methodology involves two steps: (1) Extracting three traffic indicators of the RSBs from smart card data and bus trajectory data; (2) The self-organizing map (SOM) is used to cluster and effectively recognize traffic patterns embedded in the RSBs. Furthermore, a congestion index for ranking the SOM clusters is developed to determine the congested RSBs. A case study using real-world datasets from a public transport system validates the proposed methodology. Based on the congested RSBs, an exploratory example of public transport network optimization is discussed and evaluated using a genetic algorithm. The clustering results showed that the SOM could suitably reflect the traffic characteristics and estimate traffic congestion of the RSBs. The results obtained in this study are expected to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology in sustainable public transport improvements.

ID TRANSIT
AB Smart card data derived from automatic fare collection (AFC) systems of public transit enable us to study resident movement from a macro perspective. The rhythms of traffic generated by different land uses differ, reflecting differences in human activity patterns. Thus, an understanding of daily ridership and mobility patterns requires an understanding of the relationship between daily ridership patterns and characteristics of stations and their direct environment. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated this relationship. This study aims to propose a framework of identifying urban mobility patterns and urban dynamics from a spatiotemporal perspective and pointing out the linkages between mobility and land cover/land use (LCLU). Relying on 1 month's transactions data from the AFC system of Nanjing metro, the 110 metro stations are classified into 7 clusters named as employment-oriented stations, residential-oriented stations, spatial mismatched stations, etc., each characterized by a distinct ridership pattern (combining boarding and alighting). A comparison of the peak hourly ridership of the seven clusters is conducted to verify whether the clustering results are reasonable or not. Finally, a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relationship between characteristics of the local environment and cluster membership. Results show that the classification based on ridership patterns leads to meaningful interpretable clusters and that significant associations exist between local LCLU characteristics, distance to the city center and cluster membership. The analytical framework and findings may be beneficial for improving service efficiency of public transportation and urban planning.

AB Origin-destination flow of passengers in bus networks is a crucial input to the public transport planning and operational decisions. Smart card systems in many cities, however, record only the bus boarding information (namely an open system), which makes it challenging to use smart card data for origin-destination estimations and subsequent analyses. This study addresses this research gap by proposing a machine learning approach and applying the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to estimate the alighting stops of bus trips from open smart card data. It advances the state-of-the-art by including, for the first time, weather variables and travel history of individuals in the GBDT algorithm alongside the network characteristics. The method is applied to six-month smart card data from the City of Changsha, China, with more than 17 million trip-records from 700 thousand card users. The model prediction results show that, compared to classic machine learning methods, GBDT not only yields higher prediction accuracy but more importantly is also able to rank the influencing factors on bus ridership. The results demonstrate that incorporation of weather variables and travel history further improves the prediction capability of the models. The proposed GBDT-based framework is flexible and scalable: it can be readily trained with smart card data from other cities to be used for predicting bus origin-destination flow. The results can contribute to improved transport sustainability of a city by enabling smart bus planning and operational decisions.

AB The information level of the urban public transport system is constantly improving, which promotes the use of smart cards by passengers. The OD (origination-destination) travel time of passengers reflects the temporal and spatial distribution of passenger flow. It is helpful to improve the flow efficiency of passengers and the sustainable development of the city. It is an urgent problem to select appropriate indexes to evaluate OD travel time and analyze the correlation of these indexes. More than one million OD records are generated by the AFC (Auto Fare Collection) system of Nanjing metro every day. A complex network method is proposed to evaluate and analyze OD travel time. Five working days swiping data of Nanjing metro are selected. Firstly, inappropriate data are filtered through data preprocessing. Then, the GD travel time indexes can be divided into three categories: time index, complex network index, and composite index. Time index includes use time probability, passenger flow between stations, average time between stations, and time variance between stations. The complex network index is based on two models: Space P and ride time, including the minimum number of rides, and the shortest ride time. Composite indicators include inter site flow efficiency and network flow efficiency. Based on the complex network model, this research quantitatively analyzes the Pearson correlation of the indexes of OD travel time. This research can be applied to other public transport modes in combination with big data of public smart cards. This will improve the flow efficiency of passengers and optimize the layout of the subway network and urban space.

AB Understanding the employment status of passengers in public transit systems is significant for transport operators in many real applications such as forecasting travel demand and providing personalized transportation service. This paper develops a deep learning approach to infer a passenger's employment status by using smart card data (SCD) with a household survey. This paper first extracts an individual passenger's weekly travel patterns in different travel modes from the raw SCD as a three-dimensional image. A deep learning architecture, called a thresholding multi-channel convolutional neural network, was developed to predict an individual's employment status. The approach proposed here solves two critical problems of using the SCD for employment status studies. First, it automatically incorporates learning temporal features in different travel modes without the need for handcrafted travel feature design. Second, it considers the class-imbalance problem by leveraging the ensemble of oversampling and thresholding techniques. By applying our approach to a real dataset collected from the metropolitan area of London, U.K., about 72% of passengers were correctly categorized into six types of employment statuses. The promising results show the tight correlation between temporal travel behavior, mode choice, and social-demographic roles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to infer employment status by using the SCD.

AB Sustainable urban mobility remains an emerging research topic during last decades. In recent years, the smart card data collection systems have become widespread and many studies have been focused on usage of anonymized data from these systems for better understanding of mobility patterns of Public Transport (PT) passengers. Data-driven mobility patterns can benefit transport planners at strategic, tactical, and operational levels. A particular point of interest is a spatiotemporal dynamics of mobility patterns that highlights transformation of the PT passenger flows over the time continuously or in response to modifications of the PT system and policies. This study is aimed to estimation and analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PT passenger flows in Riga (Latvia). A multi-stage methodology was proposed and includes three main stages: (1) estimation of individual trip vectors, (2) clustering of trip vectors into spatiotemporal mobility patterns, and (3) further analysis of mobility patterns' dynamics. The best practice methods are applied at every stage of the proposed methodology: the smart card validation flow is used for extracting information on boarding locations; the trip chain approach is used for estimation of individual trip destinations; vector-based clustering algorithms are utilised for identification of mobility patterns and discovering their dynamics. The resulting methodology provides an advanced tool for observing and managing of PT demand fluctuation on a daily basis. The methodology was applied for mining of a large smart card data set (124 million records) for year 2018. Most important empirical results include obtained daily mobility patterns in Riga, their clusters, and within-cluster dynamics over the year. Obtained daily mobility patterns allows estimation of a city-level PT origin-destination matrix that is useful in many applied areas, e.g., dynamic passenger flow assignment models. Mobility pattern-based clustering of days allows effective comparison and flexible tuning of the PT system for different days of a week, public holidays, extreme weather conditions, and large events. Dynamics of mobility patterns allows estimating the effect of implementing changes (e.g., fare increase or road maintenance) and demand forecasting for user-focused development of PT system.

DT Article
DE AFC data; AVL data; public transport; semiparametric regression
AB In this paper, we apply flexible data-driven analysis methods on large-scale mass transit data to identify areas for improvement in the engineering and operation of urban rail systems. Specifically, we use data from automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL) systems to obtain a more precise characterisation of the drivers of journey time variance on the London Underground, and thus an improved understanding of delay. Total journey times are decomposed via a probabilistic assignment algorithm, and semiparametric regression is undertaken to disentangle the effects of passenger-specific travel characteristics from network-related factors. For total journey times, we find that network characteristics, primarily train speeds and headways, represent the majority of journey time variance. However, within the typically twice as onerous access and egress time components, passenger-level heterogeneity is more influential. On average, we find that intra-passenger heterogeneity represents 6% and 19% of variance in access and egress times, respectively, and that inter-passenger effects have a similar or greater degree of influence than static network characteristics. The analysis shows that while network-specific characteristics are the primary drivers of journey time variance in absolute terms, a nontrivial proportion of passenger-perceived variance would be influenced by passenger-specific characteristics. The findings have potential applications related to improving the understanding of passenger movements within stations, for example, the analysis can be used to assess the relative way-finding complexity of stations, which can in turn guide transit operators in the targeting of potential interventions.

AB Transit is important for alleviating traffic congestion, air pollution, and parking problems caused by excessive auto traffic in sustainable transport systems. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance transit ridership in a city by providing a more competitive transit service. Meanwhile, with the recent development of traffic information collection technologies, it is possible to acquire more accurate and rich information on transit and auto travel times through smart card data and map-based application programming interface (API) services. In this study, we analyze transit competitiveness compared to autos in Seoul using smart card data, which can represent actual transit travel times. Auto travel information is obtained from the T map, which is the most popular navigation application in Korea. As a methodology, we present a new transit competitiveness index to measure transit competitiveness for the network-wide analysis based on the travel time. The analysis of the results shows that the transit is more competitive for the people commuting to and from two major business districts, i.e., Gangnam business district (GBD) and Central business district (CBD), in Seoul on peak hours. This means that the transit system in Seoul is well-equipped, and people can easily access to employment or other opportunities by using transit. However, there are some residential and another major business district where transit is not competitive. The results also show that variability in transit travel time at peak hours may cause a decrease in transit competitiveness. We also suggest recommendations to improve transit competitiveness in Seoul. Based on the recommendations, the Seoul government should strive to improve transit competitiveness.

AB Customized commuter bus (CCB) is a kind of innovative public transit service launched starting in 2013 in many cities all over the world. It is designed to meet the direct travel demands of commuters who have similar origin and destination locations during their long-distance commuting trips at peak hours. To identify the origin and destination distribution of potential CCB passengers, this paper proposes a pair wise density-based spatial clustering algorithm. With the proposed algorithm, the method to extract the potential CCB passengers from regular bus passengers based on the bus smart card data is introduced. Meanwhile, the discovered hot locations of potential CCB passengers can be regarded as the candidate locations of CCB stops and can be used to set candidate CCB lines. Finally, the demand survey data collected from the actual registered CCB passengers are applied to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the clustering results obtained by the proposed algorithm. The related findings could guide bus operators to design CCB lines and allocate vehicle capacities on different lines.

AB Burst passenger flow in the public transportation system is serious to public safety. Existing works mainly focused on prediction and monitoring of regular passenger flow, which are not suitable for burst passenger flow. In this article, we first formulate the problem as early warning of burst passenger flow. Next, we design a novel framework to solve this problem by our observation that a burst passenger in-flow usually comes after an abnormal passenger out-flow for a subway station, especially when there is a large-scale social crowd event. Our framework consists of two models: (1) Abnormal out-flow detection (AOFD) which detects abnormal out-flows and warns the city administration of the burst in-flow fairly ahead of time. (2) Burst in-flow peak estimation (BIFPE) which estimates burst in-flow peak time and volume. We evaluate our framework with real-world smartcard data of the largest city in China and use large-scale social crowd event data to further explain our model. The result shows that: (1) AOFD can detect abnormal out-flows that would later result in bursts in-flows with better performance and can send warning signal ahead of the time of burst passenger in-flow. (2) BIFPE can effectively estimate the peak time of burst in-flow and can reduce peak volume estimation error compared with the traditional passenger flow prediction models.

AB Free access to public transport is viewed as an effective means to enable inclusive mobility, but the recent decline in bus patronage by passengers entitled to free travel in the West Midlands and other UK regions presents a conundrum to transport research and policy. In this research, we analyse travel smartcard transactions recorded over nearly six years for 371,220 concessionary passengers resident in the West Midlands Combined Authority. Using sequence analysis, we identify six groups representing different temporal boarding profiles. We link these profiles to geo-spatial data and characterise them by means of spatial pattern detection and multinomial logit modelling. We find that, first, the decline in patronage occurs in three waves across the study period according to distinct activity patterns; second, formerly frequent (daily) passengers tend to abandon the bus and thus show the largest impact on the overall trend; third, the neighbourhood context of withdrawing passengers indicates social disadvantage, higher instance of ethnic minorities and lower car ownership rates, in other words higher risk of social exclusion. To discuss these in parts paradoxical results, we identify three causal domains social, health-related and structural - and conclude with implications for policy promoting inclusive and healthy mobility in later life.

AB The rapid development of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is gradually cultivating a smart world based on Big Data and computational infrastructures. Such reformation has initiated revolutions in various industries and is gradually reshaping our daily routines. Among these trends, the data-driven intelligentization in Urban Public Transportation Systems can bring the most significant impact to our society, because they provide pervasive reachability. Optimizing and constructing such systems, which requires deep insights into passenger behavioral patterns, is a highly domain-specific data mining task. Although computational infrastructures have provided sufficient processing capacity, the practical utilization of such data is facing several challenges: information alignment in heterogeneous data sources and information enrichment for domain-specific applications. In this article, we first propose a cross-domain method to increase the usability of data by removing the inconsistency in vehicles' positioning and passengers' transaction data. We then use rule-based methods to reconstruct latent mobility information, thereby enabling small grained trajectory based applications. Finally, we provide use cases using the reconstructed information to derive insights to the public transportation system of our target city. Our work can serve as a domain-specific information enrichment and data mining framework for CPS in smart cities.

AB This study examines the relationship between residential property values and accessibility indicators derived from transit smart card data. The use of smart card data to estimate accessibility indicators for explaining the housing market has not yet been explored in the literature. Hence, this paper employs information from Brisbane, Australia's go card and corresponding property data to develop residential property hedonic pricing models using an ordinary least square (OLS) model, a spatial lagged model (SL), a spatial error model (SE), and a geographically weighted regression (GWR). Due to the systematic coincidence between location and price similarities, these spatial econometric models yield superior goodness-of-fit over the OLS model. Using the proposed definition of public transit accessibility in this study, it was found that properties located in well-connected, well-serviced, and accessible locations generally experience premiums in their values. The results indicate that there is value added to the property market from the public investment in public transport services and infrastructure, which supports the adoption of transit funding mechanisms, such as value-capture taxes. Furthermore, the analysis of spatial interactions between transport accessibility and the housing market could be of use to policy makers to ensure a just distribution of capital investment in future infrastructure projects.

AB Recent investment in urban ferry transport has created interest in what value such systems provide in a public transport network. In some cases, ferry services are in direct competition with other land-based transport, and despite often longer travel times passengers still choose water transport. This paper seeks to identify a premium attached to urban water transit through an identification of excess travel patterns. A one-month sample of smart card transaction data for Brisbane, Australia, was used to compare bus and ferry origin-destination pairs between a selected suburban location and the central business district. Logistic regression of the data found that ferry travel tended towards longer travel times (OR = 2.282), suggesting passengers do derive positive utility from ferry journeys. The research suggests the further need to incorporate non-traditional measures other than travel time for deciding the value of water transit systems.

AB This paper proposes an innovative method of replicating the multi-modal public transport system in Singapore with high precision using smart card database. It replicates the operation of public transport system with known exogenous passenger demand and provides many operational details, including passenger inter-modal trip chains, operational timetable, and detailed transfer behaviour. The paper elaborates on the methodology of the replication including data cleaning, filtering, processing and converting the collected data to meaningful information such as bus journey trajectories and metro system timetable. Thereafter, actualised passenger trip chains are directly assigned to the replicated public transport supply. The resulting replication covers almost 96% of trips made in public transport in Singapore. It provides solid quantitative information on several aspects to support decision making, including precise temporal and spatial travel demand analysis, transfer pattern analysis, traffic condition investigation and bus utilisation analysis.

AB Public transport planners can predict passenger loads and levels of service by applying the prior knowledge about the transit network and using transit assignment models. The individual travel history data available from automated fare collection (AFC) systems bring the opportunity of understanding the individual's travel behavior, which is necessary to develop a transit assignment model. By combining the prior knowledge about the transit network with the AFC data, a transit assignment model can be calibrated. This paper proposes a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate attributes of travel time components and to calibrate a transit assignment model. In this model, route choices are represented by a multinomial logit model, and its coefficients are estimated via a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed model is specified in two ways, and in order to consider travel time variability, it is assumed that travel time on links follows a gamma distribution. In the first specification, route choice variables and parameters are the same for all transit modes of bus, train, and ferry. In the second specification, mode-specific route choice variables and parameters are defined. In order to assess the model fitness, the root-meansquare error (RMSE) between each posterior estimate and the actual observation is computed. The lowest %RMSE belongs to the third-model specification (at 15%), which indicates its high predictive power.

AB Massive data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems provide opportunities for studying both personal traveling behaviors and collective mobility patterns in urban areas. Existing studies on AFC data have primarily focused on identifying passengers' movement patterns. However, we creatively leveraged such data for identifying pickpocket suspects. Stopping pickpockets in the public transit system has been crucial for improving passenger satisfaction and public safety. Nonetheless, in practice, it is challenging to discern thieves from regular passengers. In this paper, we developed a suspect detection and surveillance system, which can identify pickpocket suspects based on their daily transit records. Specifically, we first extracted a number of useful features from each passenger's daily activities in the transit system. Then, we took a two-step approach that exploits the strengths of unsupervised outlier detection and supervised classification models to identify thieves, who typically exhibit abnormal traveling behaviors. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. We also developed a prototype system for potential uses by security personnel.

AB Understanding citywide transit patterns is important for transportation management, including city planning and route optimization. The wide deployment of automated fare collection (AFC) systems in public transit vehicles has enabled us to collect massive amounts of transit records, which capture passengers' traveling activities. Based on such transit records, origin-destination associations have been studied extensively in the literature. However, the identification of transit patterns that establish the origin-transfer-destination (OTD) associations, in spite of its importance, is underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a framework based on transit tensor factorization (TTF) to identify citywide travel patterns. In particular, we create a transit tensor, which summarizes the citywide OTD information of all passenger trips captured in the AFC records. The TTF framework imposes spatial regularization in the formulation to group nearby stations into meaningful regions and uses multitask learning to identify traffic flows among these regions at different times of the day and days of the week. Evaluated with large-scale, real-world data, our results show that the proposed TTF framework can effectively identify meaningful citywide transit patterns.

TI Passenger Travel Time Reliability for Multimodal Public Transport

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID SERVICE
AB Urban transit networks typically consist of multiple modes and the journeys may involve a transfer within or across modes. Therefore, the passenger experience of travel time reliability is based on the whole journey experience including the transfers. Although the impact of transfers on reliability has been highlighted in the literature, the existing indicators either focus on unimodal transfers only or fail to include all components of travel time in reliability measurement. This study extends the existing "reliability buffer time" metric to transit journeys with multimodal transfers and develops a methodology to calculate it using a combination of smartcard and automatic vehicle location data. The developed methodology is applied to a real-life case study for the Amsterdam transit network consisting of bus, metro, and tram lines. By using a consistent method for all journeys in the network, reliability can be compared between different transit modes or between multiple routes for the same origin-destination pair. The developed metric can be used to study the reliability impacts of policies affecting multiple transit modes. It can also be used as an input to behavioral models such as mode, route, or departure time choice models.

AB In recent years, mobility data from smart cards, mobile phones and sensors have become increasingly available. However, they often lack some of the key information including the purposes of trips for each individual user. Information on trip purposes is crucial for projecting the future travel patterns as well as understanding the characteristics of each area of a city and how it is changing. This paper proposes a method called EAT-CD (Extraction of Activity Types and Change Detection). It estimates the volume of passengers by activity types (e.g. commuting, leisure) using non-negative matrix factorization and detects changes in the number of visitors for each activity (e.g. increase in shopping trips triggered by the development of a new commercial facility). Validity of EAT-CD is tested through empirical analysis using smart card data of public transportation in Western Japan. The results showed that EAT-CD is effective in deriving activity patterns, which showed strong correlation with travel survey data. The results also confirmed that EAT-CD detects changes in travel patterns (e.g. start and end of semesters) and land uses (e.g. establishment of new facilities).

AB Smart card transactions contain user information and travel patterns. Thus, in this study, elderly smart card transactions were analyzed to determine elderly captive riders' hot spots that need appropriate social services for them. There has been minimal focus on the spatial autocorrelation of smart card big data when developing new traffic policies. Therefore, in this study, spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed using Seoul's smart card data for six weeks. In the collected data, it was found that 76.3% of the elderly trips were concentrated on subways, which offer free tickets. For this reason, we examined elderly captive bus riders in this study. Moran's I was 0.277 for the elderly smart card transactions, and it has a positive spatial autocorrelation with the significance level of 0.01. Local indicators of spatial association (LISA) analysis is used to determine the spatially autocorrelated areas. Fifty administrative units (dongs) in Seoul were considered hot spots, and spatial clustering was confirmed; 61 dongs were considered cold spots. The distributions of hot spots and cold spots seem to be closely related to the subway supply level rather than the elderly population. Twenty-eight hot spots seriously need appropriate social services for elderly bus users because those hot spots do not operate subway service. First, barrier-free bus stops should be installed at the 28 hot spots. Second, bus lines that pass the 28 hot spots need to have high priority when supplying low-floor buses. Third, the low-floor bus shuttle service from/to the 28 hot spots is proposed by analyzing the top nine origins and destinations of the elderly. To propose advanced public transportation policies for the elderly, smart card spatial autocorrelation analysis can be used.

AB Minimizing passenger transfer times through public transport (PT) transfer synchronization is important during tactical planning and real-time control. However, there are computational challenges for solving this Timetable Synchronization Problem (TSP) for large, real-world urban PT networks. Hence, in this study we propose a data-driven, passenger-oriented methodology as a preparatory selection stage to reduce problem dimensionality by (1) determining the significant transfer hubs in the network, and (2) identifying subsets of lines within these hubs that need to be prioritized for transfer synchronization. In the First phase of our methodology we determine the spatial boundaries of transfer locations, using a clustering technique based on the passenger transfer flow matrix inferred from smartcard data. After that, a subset of hubs to be prioritized for synchronization is selected. In the second phase, we characterize the transfer patterns within the hubs based on a topological representation. Based on these topological graphs, the line bundles that need to be prioritized within the hubs are further identified using a modularity-based community detection technique. We apply our methodology to a real-world case study, i.e. the PT network of The Hague, the Netherlands. For this case study, our approach allows for prioritizing 70% of all transfers within identified transfer locations while only requiring 0.9% of these transfer locations, thus reducing the complexity of solving the TSP substantially at a relatively low cost. Our method supports public transport operators during timetable design and real-time control in determining where and which lines to prioritize when devising measures for improving transfer experience and synchronization.

AB Urban metro alleviates traffic pressure and also faces safety management problems. The metro AFC (Automatic Fare Collection System) records the OD (Origin-Destination) data of passengers' daily trips. Many researches often neglect the pretreatment of data cleaning based on smart card data. Anomaly OD records also reflect the safety problems. How to use OD to identify anomalous data and passengers' anomalous behavior is a research hotspot of metro big data. OD data of Nanjing metro were analyzed, and standard data cleaning processes were proposed including inbound records until the day before yesterday, inbound records of next days, negative records and overtime records. Then, using the data after cleaning, we analyze long-time records, short-time records, inbound and outbound records between the same stations, the swiping card records of more times, and carry out analysis. One day is chosen as an example to illustrate the analysis process, and then the OD records of several days are compared to summarize the classification of OD anomalies. Through analysis, OD anomalies can be classified into two categories: system anomalies and passenger behavior anomalies. System anomalies can be eliminated by upgrading. Abnormal passenger behavior reflects some potential safety problems. This research can effectively identify the abnormal behavior of passengers by tracking and comparing the appearing frequency of passenger cards. OD anomaly classification can be further refined, so that it has more practical value, can improve the level of metro safety management.

AB Demand for public transportation is highly affected by passengers' experience and the level of service provided. Thus, it is vital for transit agencies to deploy adaptive strategies to respond to changes in demand or supply in a timely manner, and prevent unwanted deterioration in service quality. In this paper, a real time prediction methodology, based on univariate and multivariate state-space models, is developed to predict the short-term passenger arrivals at transit stations. A univariate state-space model is developed at the station level. Through a hierarchical clustering algorithm with correlation distance, stations with similar demand patterns are identified. A dynamic factor model is proposed for each cluster, capturing station interdependencies through a set of common factors. Both approaches can model the effect of exogenous events (such as football games). Ensemble predictions are then obtained by combining the outputs from the two models, based on their respective accuracy. We evaluate these models using data from the 32 stations on the Central line of the London Underground (LU), operated by Transport for London (TfL). The results indicate that the proposed methodology performs well in predicting short-term station arrivals for the set of test days. For most stations, ensemble prediction has the lowest mean error, as well as the smallest range of error, and exhibits more robust performance across the test days.

AB In urban transportation systems, transfer stations refer to hubs connecting a variety of bus and subway lines and, thus, are the most important nodes in transportation networks. The pervasive availability of large-scale travel traces of passengers, collected from automated fare collection (AFC) systems, has provided unprecedented opportunities for understanding citywide transfer patterns, which can benefit smart transportation, such as smart route recommendation to avoid crowded lines, and dynamic bus scheduling to enhance transportation efficiency. To this end, in this article, we provide a systematic study of the measurement, patterns, and modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics of passenger transfers. Along this line, we develop a data-driven analytical system for modeling the transfer volumes of each transfer station. More specifically, we first identify and quantify the discriminative patterns of spatiotemporal dynamics of passenger transfers by utilizing heterogeneous sources of transfer related data for each station. Also, we develop a multi-task spatiotemporal learning model for predicting the transfer volumes of a specific station at a specific time period. Moreover, we further leverage the predictive model of passenger transfers to provide crowdedness-aware route recommendations. Finally, we conduct the extensive evaluations with a variety of real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling method and its applications for smart transportation.

AB Property booms have caused residential spatial distribution changes in many metropolitan areas. To understand the impact of surging housing prices on the low-to-moderate income group, this study uses transit smart card data to explore whether and to what extent increasing housing affordability pressure impacts the pattern of residential spatial distribution. This analysis is based on the facts that most public transit commuters are in the low-to-moderate income group and that transit smart cards continuously record individual spatial choice behaviors. Compared with conventional approaches using census data or survey data, our approach can more quickly detect residential changes. Experimental results indicated that most low-to-moderate income dwellers lived in low-housing-cost areas with high accessibility to public transportation. Three relocation patterns were discovered based on significant changes in residential spatial distribution. The overall pattern is to move from the inner city to suburban areas or to the urban periphery, where housing costs are much lower. Specifically, these commuters moved along traffic corridors (metro lines), which indicates that their residential choices were constrained by employment locations and public transport facilities. Finally, these commuters presented a jumping relocation pattern along metro lines due to the search for low-rent housing. Our findings provide some insights into urban dynamics, as well as urban and housing policies.

AB Interchange or transfers for passengers in large multimodal public transport networks are more or less inevitable. In South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia, there is a zone based fare system in place which does not penalize transfers within the same zone but does charge a full fare for an inter-zone transfer in a single journey. This research investigates the interchange effects from an analysis of passengers' travel patterns using the smart card data from the automated fare collection system in place in SEQ. Latent class nested logit models are estimated with social demographic characteristics to measure transfer behaviour, and are used to investigate the opportunity for better interchange policies to increase the network effect. The results identified passengers' heterogeneous preferences towards travel alternatives with markedly different market segments. The empirical results identified passengers categorised into four segments of employees, students, wealthier people and seniors. The findings suggest that public transport network effects are most important to the employee segment with student and senior segments being more likely to choose direct alternatives over alternatives involving interchange. In order to enhance the public transport network effects, two transfer policies are simulated and all segments show increase of the transfer behaviour but with different alternative shares.

ID NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; OUTLIER DETECTION; PERFORMANCE
AB Smart card logs constitute a valuable source of information to model a public transportation network and characterize normal or abnormal events; however, this source of data is associated to a high level of noise and missing data, thus, it requires robust analysis tools. First, we define an anomaly as any perturbation in the transportation network with respect to a typical day: temporary interruption, intermittent habit shifts, closed stations, unusual high/low number of entrances in a station. The Parisian metro network with 300 stations and millions of daily trips is considered as a case study. In this paper, we present four approaches for the task of anomaly detection in a transportation network using smart card logs. The first three approaches involve the inference of a daily temporal prototype of each metro station and the use of a distance denoting the compatibility of a particular day and its inferred prototype. We introduce two simple and strong baselines relying on a differential modeling between stations and prototypes in the raw-log space. We implemented a raw version (sensitive to volume change) as well as a normalized version (sensitive to behavior changes). The third approach is an original matrix factorization algorithm that computes a dictionary of typical behaviors shared across stations and the corresponding weights allowing the reconstruction of denoised station profiles. We propose to measure the distance between stations and prototypes directly in the latent space. The main advantage resides in its compactness allowing to describe each station profile and the inherent variability within a few parameters. The last approach is a user-based model in which abnormal behaviors are first detected for each user at the log level and then aggregated spatially and temporally; as a consequence, this approach is heavier and requires to follow users, at the opposite of the previous ones that operate on anonymous log data. On top of that, our contribution regards the evaluation framework: we listed particular days but we also mined RATP(1) Twitter account to obtain (partial) ground truth information about operating incidents. Experiments show that matrix factorization is very robust in various situations while the last user-based model is particularly efficient to detect small incidents reported in the twitter dataset.

AB Waiting time at public transport stops is perceived by passengers to be more onerous than in vehicle time, hence it strongly influences the attractiveness and use of public transport. Transport models traditionally assume that average waiting times are half the service headway by assuming random passenger arrivals. However, research agree that two distinct passenger behaviour types exist: one group arrives randomly, whereas another group actively tries to minimise their waiting time by arriving in a timely manner at the scheduled departure time. This study proposes a general framework for estimating passenger waiting times which incorporates the arrival patterns of these two groups explicitly, namely by using a mixture distribution consisting of a uniform and a beta distribution. The framework is empirically validated using a large-scale automatic fare collection system from the Greater Copenhagen Area covering metro, suburban, and regional rail stations thereby giving a range of service headways from 2 to 60 min. It was shown that the proposed mixture distribution is superior to other distributions proposed in the literature. This can improve waiting time estimations in public transport models. The results show that even at 5-min headways 43% of passengers arrive in a timely manner to stations when timetables are available. The results bear important policy implications in terms of providing actual timetables, even at high service frequencies, in order for passengers to be able to minimise their waiting times.

AB New smart card datasets are providing new opportunities to explore travel behaviour in much greater depth than anything accomplished hitherto. Part of this quest involves measuring the great array of regular patterns within such data and explaining these relative to less regular patterns which have often been treated in the past as noise. Here we use a simple method called DBSCAN to identify clusters of travel events associated with particular individuals whose behaviour over space and time is captured by smart card data. Our dataset is a sequence of three months of data recording when and where individual travellers start and end rail and bus travel in Greater London. This dataset contains some 640 million transactions during the period of analysis we have chosen and it enables us to begin a search for regularities at the most basic level. We first define measures of regularity in terms of the proportions of events associated with temporal, modal (rail and bus), and service regularity clusters, revealing that the frequency distributions of these clusters follow skewed distributions with different means and variances. The analysis then continues to examine how regularity relative to irregular travel across space, demonstrating high regularities in the origins of trips in the suburbs contrasted with high regularities in the destinations in central London. This analysis sets the agenda for future research into how we capture and measure the differences between regular and irregular travel which we discuss by way of conclusion.

AB Understanding urban public ridership is essential for promoting public transportation. However, limited efforts have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems, and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating future transport policy.

AB Expanding our knowledge about human mobility is essential for building efficient wireless protocols and mobile applications. Previous mobility studies have typically been built upon empirical single-source data (e.g., cellphone or transit data), which inevitably introduces a bias against residents not contributing this type of data, e.g., call detail records cannot be obtained from the residents without cellphone activities, and transit data cannot cover the residents who walk or ride private vehicles. To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel architecture mPat to explore human mobility using multi-source urban network data. A reference implementation of mPat was developed at an unprecedented scale upon the urban infrastructures of Shenzhen, China. The novelty and uniqueness of mPat lie in its three layers: 1) a data feed layer consisting of real-time data feeds from various urban networks with 24 thousand vehicles, 16 million smart cards, and 10 million cellphones; 2) a mobility abstraction layer exploring correlation and divergence among multi-source data to infer human mobility with a context-aware optimization model based on block coordinate decent; and 3) an application layer to improve urban efficiency based on the human mobility findings of the study. The evaluation shows that mPat achieves a 79% inference accuracy, and that its real-world application reduces passenger travel time by 36%.

ID CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; BIG DATA
AB Analysis of passenger travel habits is always an important item in traffic field. However, passenger travel patterns can only be watched through a period time, and a lot of people travel by public transportation in big cities like Beijing daily, which leads to large-scale data and difficult operation. Using SPARK platform, this paper proposes a trip reconstruction algorithm and adopts the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to mine the travel patterns of each Smart Card (SC) user in Beijing. For the phenomenon that passengers swipe cards before arriving to avoid the crowd caused by the people of the same destination, the algorithm based on passenger travel frequent items is adopted to guarantee the accuracy of spatial regular patterns. At last, this paper puts forward a model based on density and node importance to gather bus stations. The transportation connection between areas formed by these bus stations can be seen with the help of SC data. We hope that this research will contribute to further studies.

TI Analysis of Bus Trip Characteristics and Demand Forecasting Based on
   NARX Neural Network Model
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, there has been increased interest in the use of bus IC card data to analyze bus transit time characteristics, and the prediction is no longer confined to rail traffic passenger flow prediction and traditional traffic flow prediction. Research on passenger flow forecast for the bus IC card has been increasing year by year. Based on the bus IC card data of Qingdao City, this paper first analyzes the characteristics of one-day passenger flow and passenger flow during subperiods and conducts a separate study on the characteristics of the elderly. The results show that the travel of the elderly is also affected by the weekday and the weekend. Then, based on the ARIMA model and the NARX neural network model, the passenger flow forecasting (10-minute interval) is carried out using the IC card data of No. 1 bus for 5 weekdays. The prediction results show that the NARX neural network model is effective in the short-term prediction of bus passenger flow, and especially, it is more accurate in the peak hour and large-scale data prediction.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB In urban cities, multiple intelligent transportation systems generate a large amount of traffic data. Researchers can make well use of these data to provide solutions for solving numerous existing traffic problems, such as traffic congestions and urban transportation resource allocating. Thus, it is meaningful and feasible for traffic researchers to collect these data and analyze the concealed human mobility based on them. In this paper, we propose a visual interactive subway system (VISOS). The system incorporates subway data visualization module, spatial-temporal exploration module, and station clustering module. VISOS utilizes k-means clustering algorithm to explore the subway data interactively, analyze human mobility pattern responsively, and identify functional characteristics of subway stations precisely. In addition, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive spatial-temporal exploration based on the real Shanghai subway data to analyze the importance level of subway stations.

AB The availability of smart card data from public transport travelling the last decades allows analyzing current and predicting future public transport usage. Public transport models are commonly applied to predict ridership due to structural network changes, using a calibrated parameter set. Predicting the impact of planned disturbances, like temporary track closures, on public transport ridership is however an unexplored area. In the Netherlands, this area becomes increasingly important, given the many track closures operators are confronted with the last and upcoming years. We investigated the passenger impact of four planned disturbances on the public transport network of The Hague, the Netherlands, by comparing predicted and realized public transport ridership using smart card data. A three-step search procedure is applied to find a parameter set resulting in higher prediction accuracy. We found that in-vehicle time in rail-replacing bus services is perceived times more negatively compared to in-vehicle time perception in the initial tram line. Waiting time for temporary rail-replacement bus services is found to be perceived approximate to 1.3 times higher, compared to waiting time perception for regular tram and bus services. Besides, passengers do not seem to perceive the theoretical benefit of the usually higher frequency of rail-replacement bus services compared to the frequency of the replaced tram line. For the different case studies, the new parameter set results in 3% up to 13% higher prediction accuracy compared to the default parameter set. It supports public transport operators to better predict the required supply of rail-replacement services and to predict the impact on their revenues.

DE Additive models; transportation demand; Gaussian processes; expectation
   propagation
AB Public special events, like sports games, concerts and festivals are well known to create disruptions in transportation systems, often catching the operators by surprise. Although these are usually planned well in advance, their impact is difficult to predict, even when organisers and transportation operators coordinate. The problem highly increases when several events happen concurrently. To solve these problems, costly processes, heavily reliant on manual search and personal experience, are usual practice in large cities like Singapore, London or Tokyo. This paper presents a Bayesian additive model with Gaussian process components that combines smart card records from public transport with context information about events that is continuously mined from the Web. We develop an efficient approximate inference algorithm using expectation propagation, which allows us to predict the total number of public transportation trips to the special event areas, thereby contributing to a more adaptive transportation system. Furthermore, for multiple concurrent event scenarios, the proposed algorithm is able to disaggregate gross trip counts into their most likely components related to specific events and routine behavior. Using real data from Singapore, we show that the presented model outperforms the best baseline model by up to 26 percent in R-2 and also has explanatory power for its individual components.

AB Planners must understand how public transportation systems are used in order to make strategic decisions. Smart card transaction data provides vast, detailed records of network usage. Combined with other automatically collected data sources, established inference methodologies can convert smart card transactions into complete linked journeys made by individuals within the public transport network. However, for large, multi-modal public transport networks it can be challenging to summarize the journey records meaningfully. This paper develops a method for categorizing origin-destination (OD) pairs by public transport mode or combination of used modes. By aggregating across OD pairs, this categorization scheme summarizes the multi-modal aspects of public transport network usage. The methodology can also be applied to subsets of data filtered by time of day or geography. The categorization results can inform performance analysis of OD pairs, allowing planners to make comparisons between pairs served by different combinations of modes. London Oyster card data is analyzed to illustrate how the OD pair categorization can characterize a network, allowing planners to quickly assess the roles of different modes, and perform OD pair analysis in a multi-modal public transport network.

AB In recent years, there has been increased interest in using completely anonymized data from smart card collection systems to better understand the behavioural habits of public transport passengers. Such an understanding can benefit urban transport planners as well as urban modelling by providing simulation models with realistic mobility patterns of transit networks. In particular, the study of temporal activities has elicited substantial interest. In this regard, a number of methods have been developed in the literature for this type of analysis, most using clustering approaches. This paper presents a two-level generative model that applies the Gaussian mixture model to regroup passengers based on their temporal habits in their public transportation usage. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it can model a continuous representation of time instead of having to employ discrete time bins. For each cluster, the approach provides typical temporal patterns that enable easy interpretation. The experiments are performed on five years of data collected by the Societe de transport de l'Outaouais. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in identifying a reduced set of passenger clusters linked to their fare types. A five-year longitudinal analysis also shows the relative stability of public transport usage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metro systems play an important role in meeting the demand for urban transportation in large cities. The understanding of passenger route choice is critical for public transit management. The wide deployment of automated fare collection (AFC) systems opens up a new opportunity. However, only each trip's tap-in and tap-out time stamp and stations can be directly obtained from AFC system records; the train and route chosen by a passenger are unknown, information necessary to solve our problem. While existing methods work well in some specific situations, they hardly work for complicated situations. In this paper, we propose a solution that needs no additional equipment or human involvement than the AFC systems. We develop a probabilistic model that can estimate fromempirical analysis how the passenger flows are dispatched to different routes and trains. We validate our approach using a large-scale data set collected from the Shenzhen Metro system. The measured results provide us with useful input when building the passenger path choice model.

AB Smart card data gathered by automated fare collection (AFC) systems are valuable resources for studying urban mobility. In this paper, we propose two approaches to cluster smart card data, which can be used to extract mobility patterns in a public transportation system. Two complementary standpoints are considered: a station-oriented operational point of view and a passenger-focused one. The first approach clusters stations based on when their activity occurs, i. e., how trips made at the stations are distributed over time. The second approach makes it possible to identify groups of passengers that have similar boarding times aggregated into weekly profiles. By applying our approaches to a real data set issued from the metropolitan area of Rennes, France, we illustrate how they can help reveal valuable insights about urban mobility, such as the presence of different station key roles, including residential stations used mostly in the mornings and work stations used only in the evening and almost exclusively during weekdays, as well as different passenger behaviors ranging from the sporadic and diffuse usage to typical commute practices. By cross comparing passenger clusters with fare types, we also highlight how certain usages are more specific to particular types of passengers.

AB The existing studies concerning the influence of weather on public transport have mainly focused on the impacts of average weather conditions on the aggregate ridership of public transit. Not much research has examined these impacts at disaggregate levels. This study aims to fill this gap by accounting for intra-day variations in weather as well as public transport ridership and investigating the effect of weather on the travel behavior of individual public transit users. We have collected smart card data for public transit and meteorological records from Shenzhen, China for the entire month of September 2014. The data allow us to establish association between the system-wide public transit ridership and weather condition on not only daily, but also hourly basis and for each metro station. In addition, with the detailed trip records of individual card holders, the travel pattern by public transit are constructed for card holders and this pattern is linked to the weather conditions he/she has experienced. Multivariate modeling approach is applied to analyze the influence of weather on public transit ridership and the travel behavior of regular transit users. Results show that some weather elements have more influence than others on public transportation. Metro stations located in urban areas are more vulnerable to outdoor weather in regard to ridership. Regular transit users are found to be rather resilient to changes in weather conditions. Findings contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between everyday weather and public transit travels and also provide valuable information for short-term scheduling in transit management.

AB The public transport industry faces challenges in catering to the variety of mobility patterns and corresponding needs and preferences of passengers. Travel habit surveys provide information on overall travel demand as well as its spatial variation. However, that information often does not include information on temporal variations. By applying data fusion to smartcard and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) data, researchers were able to examine spatial and temporal patterns of public transport usage versus overall travel demand. The analysis was performed by contrasting different spatial and temporal levels of smartcard and GSM data. The methodology was applied to a case study in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to analyze whether the current service span is adequate. The results suggested that there is potential demand for extending public transport service on both ends. In the early mornings, right before transit operations are resumed, an hourly increase in visitor occupancy of 33% to 88% was observed in several zones, showing potential demand for additional public transport services. The proposed data fusion method was shown to be valuable in supporting tactical transit planning and decision making and can easily be applied to other origin-destination transport data.

AB Commuting reflects the long-term travel behavior of people and significantly impacts urban traffic congestion and emission. Recent advances in data availability provide new opportunities to understand commuting patterns efficiently and effectively. This study develops a series of data mining methods to identify the spatiotemporal commuting patterns of Beijing public transit riders. Using one-month transit smart card data, we measure spatiotemporal regularity of individual commuters, including residence, workplace, and departure time. This data could be used to identify transit commuters by leveraging spatial clustering and multi-criteria decision analysis approaches. A disaggregated-level survey is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with a commuter identification accuracy that reaches as high as 94.1%. By visualizing the spatial distribution of the homes and workplaces of transit commuters, we determine a clear disparity between commuters and noncommuters and confirm the existence of job-house imbalance in Beijing. The findings provide Useful insights for policymakers to shape a more balanced job-housing relationship by adjusting the monocentric urban structure of Beijing. In addition, the extracted individual-level commuting patterns can be used as valuable information for public transit network design and optimization. These strategies are expected to reduce car dependency, shorten excess commute, and alleviate traffic congestion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urbanization and modernization accelerate the evolution of urban morphology with the formation of different functional regions. To develop a smart city, how to efficiently identify the functional regions is crucial for future urban planning. Differed from the existing works, we mainly focus on how to identify the latent functions of subway stations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework (IS2Fun) to identify spatio-temporal functions of stations in a city. We apply the semantic model Doc2vec to mine the semantic distribution of subway stations based on human mobility patterns and points of interest (POIs), which sense the dynamic (people's social activities) and static characteristics (POI categories) of each station. We examine the correlation between mobility patterns of commuters and travellers and the spatio-temporal functions of stations. In addition, we develop the POI feature vectors to jointly explore the functions of stations from a perspective of static geographic location. Subsequently, we leverage affinity propagation algorithm to cluster all the stations into ten functional clusters and obtain the latent spatio-temporal functions. We conduct extensive experiments based on the massive urban data, including subway smart card transaction data and POIs to verify that the proposed framework IS2Fun outperforms existing benchmark methods in terms of identifying the functions of subway stations.

ID ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRIX; SMARTCARD DATA; VEHICLE LOCATION; MODEL;
   ASSIGNMENT
AB Journey time is one of the key factors of public transport quality of service that is of concern to passengers. The variability in passenger journey time stems from the variability of in-vehicle travel time, walking time, and waiting time. A better understanding of passenger walking and waiting behavior along an urban rail transit line, especially in mass transit hubs and stations, is thus of much relevance. However, the estimation of passengers' walking speed, walking distance, and waiting time is still a complicated and difficult task: individual walking speed and waiting time keep changing throughout the interindividual journey. A novel stochastic model that uses automated fare collection data and automatic vehicle location data is proposed to estimate the distributions of walking speed, walking distance, and waiting time indirectly. The stochastic model relates tap-out time to tap-in time on an individual basis and with respect to train circulation on the basis of statistical distributions for the individual's cruise walking speed, in-station walking distance, and waiting time. Analytical formulas are provided, first conditional to an individual walking speed and waiting time and then without conditions. The model is applied to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters with constrained numerical optimization. A case study of the urban rail transit line Reseau Express Regional [Regional Express Network (RER)] A in the Paris region yielded reasonable parameter values and factor mean values. This study paves the way for estimating passenger elementary travel time along a journey.

AB This paper broadens the research on weather and public transport usage by considering the micro dynamics of the effect that various weather conditions impose on micro geographic patterns of bus ridership in Brisbane, Australia. A smart card data set and detailed measurements of weather, allied with a suite of statistical and visual analytic techniques, are employed to capture the effect of weather on the local variations of bus ridership. While changes in weather conditions do not significantly affect bus ridership at the system level, some marked influence was found for rainfall, wind speed and relative humidity at a sub-system level. In addition, discernible variations of both the magnitude and direction of weather's effect were found at the sub-system level. Developing a more geographically detailed understanding of the effect of weather on public transport services serves as a critical first step towards establishing a more weather-resilient public transport system. This new understanding has the potential to contribute to an evidence base that can be used to proactively adjust public transport services in response to changes in weather conditions across different parts of the network. Further research is needed to assess how transferable our findings are to other public transport and climatic contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The estimation of differences in the value of in-vehicle time sitting and standing is usually made with stated choice (SC) data, partly due to the lack of revealed preference data. In this paper, we use the observed behaviour of a subset of metro users in Singapore, who are willing to travel a longer time (into the opposite direction or backwards) to secure a seat for the actual trip in the direction towards their destination. We use smart card transactions to estimate the share of users who are willing to travel in the opposite direction during the first part of their trip and the average train occupancy per section to estimate differences in the valuation of travel time sitting and standing - translated into a standing multiplier or standing premium, which is analogous to the crowding multiplier that is usually found in the crowding valuation literature. We find that the standing multiplier is between 1.18 and 1.24 with the current crowding levels in the morning peak and can be as much as 1.55 with a density of 3 standing passengers per square metre. The results are compared to previous SC studies from other countries. The values found here are an indication of a standing premium that can be used to assess the social benefit of increasing the seat capacity of a public transport system and of applying peak spreading strategies.

AB The public transport networks of dense cities such as London serve passengers with widely different travel patterns. In line with the diverse lives of urban dwellers, activities and journeys are combined within days and across days in diverse sequences. From personalized customer information, to improved travel demand models, understanding this type of heterogeneity among transit users is relevant to a number of applications core to public transport agencies' function. In this study, passenger heterogeneity is investigated based on a longitudinal representation of each user's multi-week activity sequence derived from smart card data. We propose a methodology leveraging this representation to identify clusters of users with similar activity sequence structure. The methodology is applied to a large sample (n = 33,026) from London's public transport network, in which each passenger is represented by a continuous 4-week activity sequence. The application reveals 11 clusters, each characterized by a distinct sequence structure. Socio-demographic information available for a small sample of users (n = 1973) is combined to smart card transactions to analyze associations between the identified patterns and demographic attributes including passenger age, occupation, household composition and income, and vehicle ownership. The analysis reveals that significant connections exist between the demographic attributes of users and activity patterns identified exclusively from fare transactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an analysis of regularity in public transport usage based on a large-scale bus transportation data of Lisbon, Portugal. By exploring the combined information from the bus boarding history of riders and bus arrivals at each bus stop, an analysis of individual bus usage was performed. Daily and weekly patterns were extracted, from which it was observed that a rider takes, on average, 2 trips, visits 1.93 distinct stops, and uses 1.55 distinct bus lines daily. Inter-trip time analysis revealed a daily cycle, and a study of the interaction between riders and bus infrastructure explored how usage was concentrated on particular bus lines and stops.

LA English
DT Article
DE Automated fare collection; O-D matrix; public transport; spatial
   validation; travel patterns
AB A methodology for estimating the destination of passenger journeys from automated fare collection (AFC) system data is described. It proposes new spatial validation features to increase the accuracy of destination inference results and to verify key assumptions present in previous origin-destination estimation literature. The methodology applies to entry-only system configurations combined with distance-based fare structures, and it aims to enhance raw AFC system data with the destination of individual journeys. This paper describes an algorithm developed to implement the methodology and the results from its application to bus service data from Porto. The data relate to an AFC system integrated with an automatic vehicle location system that records a transaction for each passenger boarding a bus, containing attributes regarding the route, the vehicle, and the travel card used, along with the time and the location where the journey began. Some of these are recorded for the purpose of allowing onboard ticket inspection but additionally enable innovative spatial validation features introduced by the methodology. The results led to the conclusion that the methodology is effective for estimating journey destinations at the disaggregate level and identifies false positives reliably.

AB In recent years, express bus service has come into the spotlight by overcoming slow bus operating speeds while maintaining its accessibility when it operates with local bus services. This study developed an optimal limited-stop bus routes selection (LSBRS) guideline as a scenario-based analysis and compared it with case study results. Smart card data and a genetic algorithm (GA) were used to develop the model with different scenarios. Then, total travel time savings as a result of implementing limited-stop bus service generated by the GA model were computed. The effectiveness of each factor was verified by multiple regression analysis, and the LSBRS methodology was determined. This methodology was applied to Suwon, Korea, as a case study. As a result, travel time savings were estimated to be 9.0-19.0%. The ranking of the total travel time savings proposed by the LSBRS methodology presented a similar tendency with that of the case-study analysis.

DE Spatial travel pattern; Public transport; Smart Card; AFC; DBSCAN
AB Smart Card Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data has been extensively exploited to understand passenger behavior, passenger segment, trip purpose and improve transit planning through spatial travel pattern analysis. The literature has been evolving from simple to more sophisticated methods such as from aggregated to individual travel pattern analysis, and from stop-to-stop to flexible stop aggregation. However, the issue of high computing complexity has limited these methods in practical applications. This paper proposes a new algorithm named Weighted Stop Density Based Scanning Algorithm with Noise (WS-DBSCAN) based on the classical Density Based Scanning Algorithm with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect and update the daily changes in travel pattern. WS-DBSCAN converts the classical quadratic computation complexity DBSCAN to a problem of sub-quadratic complexity. The numerical experiment using the real AFC data in South East Queensland, Australia shows that the algorithm costs only 0.45% in computation time compared to the classical DBSCAN, but provides the same clustering results.

TI Reconstructing individual mobility from smart card transactions: a
   collaborative space alignment approach
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Smart card; Space alignment; Mobility; Collaborative filtering
AB Smart card transactions capture rich information of human mobility and urban dynamics and therefore are of particular interest to urban planners and location-based service providers. However, since most transaction systems are only designated for billing purpose, typically, fine-grained location information, such as the exact boarding and alighting stops of a bus trip, is only partially or not available at all, which blocks deep exploitation of this rich and valuable data at individual level. This paper presents a collaborative space alignment framework to reconstruct individual mobility history from a metropolitan-scale smart card transaction dataset. Specifically, we show that by delicately aligning the monetary space and geospatial space with the temporal space, we are able to extrapolate a series of critical domain-specific constraints. Later, these constraints are naturally incorporated into a semi-supervised conditional random field (CRF) to infer the exact boarding and alighting stops of all transit routes, where the features of the CRF model consist of not only pre-defined indicator features extracted from individual trips but also latent features crafted from different users' trips using collaborative filtering. Here, we consider two types of collaborative features: (1) the similarity in terms of users' choices of bus lines and (2) latent temporal patterns of users' commuting behaviors. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves a high accuracy, e.g., given only 10 % trips with known alighting/boarding stops, and we successfully inferred more than 79 % alighting and boarding stops from all unlabeled trips. In particular, we validated that the extracted collaborative features significantly contribute to the accuracy of our model. In addition, we have demonstrated that by applying our approach to enrich the data, the performance of a conventional method for identifying users' home and work places can be dramatically improved (with 83 % improvement on home detection and 38 % improvement on work place detection). The proposed method offers the possibility to mine individual mobility from common public transit transactions, and showcases how uncertain data can be leveraged with domain knowledge and constraints, to support cross-application data-mining tasks.

   card data
AB Cities are complex systems. They contain different functional areas originally defined by planning and then reshaped by actual needs and use by the inhabitants. Estimating the functions of urban space is of significant importance for detecting urban problems, evaluating planning strategies, and supporting policy making. In light of the potential of data mining and spatial analysis techniques for urban analysis, this paper proposes a method to infer urban functions at the building level using transportation data obtained from surveys and smart card systems. Specifically, we establish a two-step framework making use of the spatial relationships between trips, stops, and buildings. Firstly, information about the travel purposes for daily activities is deduced using passengers' mobility patterns based on a probabilistic Bayesian model. Secondly, building functions are inferred by linking daily activities to the buildings surrounding the stops based on spatial statistics. We demonstrate the proposed method using large-scale public transportation data from two areas of Singapore. Our method is applied to identify building functions at building level. The result is verified with master plan, street view, and investigated data, and limitations are identified. Our work shows that the presented method is applicable in practice with a good accuracy. In a broader context, it shows the effectiveness of applying integrated techniques to combine multi-source data in order to make insights about social activities and complex urban space.

AB This paper analyses the influence of meteorological conditions on the number of public bus trips made for leisure, shopping and personal business in Gipuzkoa, Spain. The ridership transit data employed were obtained from the data generated by a CAD/AVL system (Computer-aided dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location) that simultaneously manages the data coming from all o the bus operators in the region. So, the study analyses the trips actually made by the entire population without resorting to sample data or aggregate behavioural studies, confirming as an added value of smart technologies their potentialities as a source of information. To determine the reasons for travelling, only journeys made on Saturdays and Sundays were studied for all weekends in 2010 and 2011. Multiple linear regression results showed that wind and rain could result in a decrease in the number of trips, while a temperature rise caused an increase in the number of trips, in agreement with the results of previous survey-based studies. Finally, both regular and occasional travellers were found to share this behavioural pattern. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The travel patterns of senior citizens in Seoul were analyzed using Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data. The focus was specifically on mode choices and transfer patterns. The results showed that 99% of trips made by senior citizens (individuals over 65 years old), who were given free subway transit passes, consisted of single-mode trips. The average travel time was 31 minutes, and subway travel times were longer than bus travel times. Individuals made fewer transfers, took longer metro trips, and paid smaller fares when using their free subway transit cards. They were more negatively sensitive to bus travel time. than metro travel time. Encouraging older adult travellers to use transfers that increase costs to a modest extent might help improve travel quality among a group of individuals who find it difficult to enter the metro system or who are uncomfortable making inter-metro transfers. Additionally, as older adults have more time, yet are economically disadvantaged and take more leisure trips, travel improvements could include adopting a time-flexible fare discount. These improvements are discussed in terms of the individual and social benefits afforded to transit passengers in South Korea.

ID CHOICE SET GENERATION; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; MODEL
AB This paper introduces a new discrete choice model aimed at describing behaviour of public transport passengers at stops. We assume that passengers choose a set of buses from which they take the first arriving. This leads to a nested model formulation in which the upper level (choice set formation) is based on utility maximisation. The lower level choice of a specific bus from the choice set is given by the frequency distribution of the bus arrivals. We further consider hyperpath characteristics in the choice set formulation which means that the utility of the choice set in general increases with the addition of further options due to a reduction in the reduced waiting time. We discuss model properties and apply our model to some selected OD pairs of the bus network of a local city in Japan where we could observe passenger behaviour due to the availability of smart card data. We find that choice sets vary fairly significantly between some passenger groups and discuss implications for transit assignment models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Smartcard data; London Overground
ID RELIABILITY
AB Excess journey time (EJT), the difference between actual passenger journey times and journey times implied by the published timetable, strikes a useful balance between the passenger's and operator's perspectives of public transport service quality. Using smartcard data, this paper tried to characterize transit service quality with EJT under heterogeneous incidence behavior (arrival at boarding stations). A rigorous framework was established for analyzing EJT, in particular for reasoning about passenger' journey time standards as implied by varying incidence behavior. It was found that although the wrong assumption about passenger incidence behavior and journey time standards could result in a biased estimate of EJT for individual passenger journeys, the unified estimator of EJT proposed in this paper is unbiased at the aggregate level regardless of the passenger incidence behavior (random incidence, scheduled incidence, or a mixture of both). A case study based on the London Overground network (with a tap-in-and-tap-out smartcard system) was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. EJT was estimated using the smartcard (Oyster) data at various levels of spatial and temporal aggregation in order to measure and evaluate the service quality. Aggregate EJT was found to vary substantially across the different London Overground lines and across time periods of weekday service. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE ITS; public transportation; Smart Cards; Automated Fare Control
AB The Smart Card Automated Fare Collection (SCAFC) system is an Intelligent Transportation System that is becoming increasingly popular among transit operators. In addition to fare control, the data collected by these systems can be very useful in transit planning. Many SCAFC systems store the location where the passenger boarded due to the positioning device carried on board; however, in most systems alighting locations are not validated and, thus, not stored in databases. This article presents a model to estimate the destination l location for each individual boarding a bus with a smart card. Experiments carried out with a database programming approach show that the data must be thoroughly validated and corrected prior to the estimation process. The first application of the model provided a success rate of 66% for destination estimation, reaching abut 80% at peak hours. Further research will tackle the issues of error detection, correction, and link results, comparing them with tho se of other data sources.

AB This study examines the potential of using smart card data in public transit systems to infer attributes of travelers, thereby facilitating a more user-centered public transport service design while reducing the use of expensive and time-consuming travel surveys. This is challenging since travel behaviors vary significantly over the population, space, and time and developing meaningful links between them and traveler attributes are not trivial. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive analysis of spatio-temporal travel behavior patterns using smart card data from the Greater Sydney area (Opal card), and then develop a Hybrid Neural Network to utilize spatial and temporal dependencies in the dataset. In particular, we first empirically analyze passengers' movements and mobility patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives and design a set of discriminative features to characterize the patterns. We then propose a deep-learning-based framework to investigate spatial and temporal features in order to infer traveler attributes. The proposed modeling framework consists of two components, i.e., a Product-based Spatial-Temporal Module (PSTM) and an Auto-Encoder-based Compression Module (AECM). PSTM encodes the relationships across a variety of features while AECM derives useful spatial information from a transit stop matrix. The proposed model is tested and evaluated using a large-scale public transport dataset in the Greater Sydney area to infer two attributes of passengers, i.e., the age group and residential area. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against a number of established tools in the literature. The developed techniques can be potentially adapted to other domains where spatio-temporal features are critical, such as commercial/entertainment site selection and urban service planning.

ID SMARTCARD; BEHAVIOR; STATIONS; DEMAND
AB The transfer between bus and metro is an integral part of the public transportation system, but accurately identifying transfer patterns and real-time transfer demands at each metro station for different transfer modes remains a vital issue. Existing identification methods are based mainly on a one-size-fits-all fixed transfer time threshold, or dynamic transfer identification methods only for the metro-to-bus mode, which is not sufficient for mining the hourly transfer characteristics of different transfer modes at each station. This study combined bus smart card (SC) data and the corresponding bus Global Positioning System (GPS) track data into one data set to infer the bus boarding stops. A new algorithm to identify transfer characteristics based on two rules about dynamic transfer time threshold and distance threshold is proposed for the metro-to-bus mode. A new method to recognize transfer patterns based on dynamic transfer time thresholds is presented for the bus-to-metro mode. The two proposed transfer recognition methods were validated using survey data from Shenzhen, China. The results show that the distribution of transfer time by the proposed methods is consistent with that of the survey data. The p-values of Mann-Whitney U tests of transfer data identified by the method and survey data all were greater than 0.05. This indicates that the methods proposed in this study can identify effectively the transfer patterns at each metro station per hour of the day, with good generalizability. Moreover, the proposed methods can explain transfer patterns and hourly transfer demand at each station for different transfer modes better than other methods.

In this paper, we focus on analysing travel choices of affected regular passengers under train delays by utilizing the data collected through an automatic fare collection (AFC) system along with train delay log records. Along this line, we propose a data-driven four-stage framework for studying regular passengers' responses under delays, consisting of data profiling, regular passenger screening and travel patterns extraction, affected regular passenger identification, and affected passenger behaviour prediction modelling. Using a real-world case of the Shenzhen Metro in China, we conduct extensive experiments for method validation and feature insights analysis. The proposed framework could provide a microscopic view of passenger travel behaviours under train delays for fine prediction and exhibit a possibility for multi-source heterogeneous data mining in passenger behaviour analysis and train delay-related tasks.

AB Smart cards, integrated circuit cards, are frequently used to pay transportation fees in many countries such as the United States, the European Union, Korea and others. Smart card transaction histories in public transportation have been used in making diverse traffic policies. Unfortunately, data preprocessing is required to organize records to extract useful information since the raw data contain artifacts and incomplete information. The paired data, i.e. a boarding and its associated alighting, are one of the key pieces of information required to yield the city traffic demand. However, it is difficult to gather the paired data mainly because the card tagging policies and data collecting methods vary from city to city and from institution to institution. The broken trip links between the boarding and its associated alighting information are the most frequent incomplete data in the smart card histories. Although huge budgets are spent on annual traffic surveys in many countries, there are no accurate Smart card data analysis methods that cover all city cases due to high data complexity and limited base information. Among these two restrictions, limited information is more difficult to resolve because it has a large codomain, thousands of stops, for inference under tiny samples. It gives handicaps of applying well-known high-performance approaches such as deep learning and probability analysis. We propose a reconstruction method by a customized clustering algorithm based on coordinates of transactions-occurred stops, user trip histories and actual vehicle movement trajectories for incomplete trip pairs. The proposed method is derived from evaluating each passenger's historical clusters and trip patterns. In a blind test 79.1% accuracy is achieved in predicting missing alighting stops while conventional methods reach only 42.3% accuracy.

AB A strategic public transport equilibrium model is developed that considers each user's trip decision, covering the choices of access stop, mode and line, alighting stop, and transfer or egress. At each stage, these choices are considered to be stochastic and made under capacity constraints resulting in waiting time increases at stops and stations due to demand levels and/or arriving vehicle loads. The modeling strategy is based on the hyper-path concept, but rather than evaluate user strategies, the approach models transitions at all individual nodes, thus facilitating computational efficiency. In this approach, we develop a recursive method different from resolving explicitly a recursion based on Bellman ' s equation, which is suitable for large and dense transit networks. A method is presented for estimating the model parameters, which was applied to the real case of the Santiago, Chile transit system based on passive transaction datasets generated by users' smart cards and GPS technology aboard the system's buses. These data were used to estimate alighting stops and an exhaustive and disaggregate reconstruction of all user trips. Once calibrated, the model proved able to predict the trip assignments observed in the calibration dataset as well as datasets from later periods, making predictions that closely fit the observations and adapting well to changes in network topology, operating patterns, and user demand. Therefore, the model should have considerable potential as a powerful, flexible, and highly useful tool for system regulators and operators who define public transport structures, operations, and policies.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented impact on public transport demand. Even though several studies have investigated the change in the use of public transport during the pandemic, most existing studies where large passive datasets have been considered focus on the drop in ridership at the aggregate level. To address this gap, this research aims to identify and model profiles of passengers considering their public transport recovery after the long-term lockdown in Santiago, Chile, during the early stage of the pandemic. The methodology proposed a three-stage approach associated with the analysis of smart card records. First, cardholder residential areas were identified to enrich the available data by integrating demographic information from the census. Then, a clustering analysis was applied to recognise distinctive classes of users based on their public transport usage change between the pre-pandemic and the post-lockdown phase. Finally, two different models were implemented to uncover the relationships between class membership and travellers' characteristics (i.e. travel history and demographic characteristics of their residential area). Results revealed a heterogeneous recovery of public transport usage among passengers, summarising them into two recognisable classes: those who mainly returned to their pre-pandemic patterns and those who adapted their mobility profiles. A statistically significant association of travel history with the mobility adaptation profile was found, as well as with aggregate socio-demographic attributes. These insights about the extent of heterogeneity and its drivers can help in the formulation of specific policies associated with public transport supply in the post-pandemic era.

AB In a crowded metro network, it is not unusual to observe that passengers actively choose not to board but wait for the next train for a seat, even if there is vacant standing room on the arriving train. We analyse such behaviour using a logit-based choice model based on revealed preference data collected from the smart card records and the operational timetables. The choice model considers waiting time, fluctuating crowding levels, and passengers' expected seat availability at each station on their trip. The revealed preference data are collected based on an existing time component framework, which can estimate passengers' itineraries by dividing passengers' travel time into time components (i.e. access, egress, boarding delay, and transfer-walking times) and analysing their uncertainty. We improve the time component framework by developing methods for estimating distributions corresponding to each time component. Using Chengdu Metro as a case, we find that the extra waiting time resulting from active boarding delay and standing time is valued 50.5% more positively and 25.3% more negatively than the in-vehicle sitting time, respectively. By comparing our findings with studies focused on passive boarding delays caused by fully loaded trains, we suggest that extra waiting time due to active and passive boarding delays should be explicitly distinguished in practice. The estimation results of the distributions for the time components indicate that access and egress walking times follow different distributions at given stations, as opposed to the assumption in most prior studies.

AB Public transport crowding exposure is known to cause discomfort, stress and dissatisfaction. However, the dis-tribution and equity of crowding exposure across socioeconomic groups has been largely unexplored. This paper opens a new research topic connecting crowding exposure in public transport to travelers' socioeconomic characteristics. We present a framework for assessing the equity of in-vehicle crowding exposure based on automatic data sources. Two metrics are considered for quantifying the travelers' in-vehicle crowding exposure: (1) the excess perceived travel time and (2) the relative excess perceived travel time. The proposed methodology computes the two metrics based on travel diaries and in-vehicle loads inferred from automated fare collection data. We implement Lorenz curves, Gini and Suits coefficients to evaluate horizontal (across the population) and vertical equity (considering income as well as mobility ability and need). The vertical equity is further discussed using clusters of socioeconomic groups and results from spatial lag regression models to assess the distribution of crowding exposure across socioeconomic characteristics. The results for the Stockholm Region case study indi-cate that crowding exposure varies substantially across the service area, with the highest values found in the denser urban areas close to Stockholm City. We find that the distribution across socioeconomic groups is rela-tively even, but travelers from areas that are wealthier, higher educated, have higher share of rental housing or lower vehicle ownership areas tend to be exposed to more crowding. The paper provides tools to support public transport planners in decision-making, showing where to intervene to reduce crowding exposure efficiently to achieve urban equity and sustainability.

AB Spatiotemporal analysis of passenger mobility patterns provides valuable information regarding the travel behaviour of passengers at different spatial and temporal scales. However, in the spatiotemporal analysis of passenger mobility patterns, a few questions are yet to be answered: how does passenger travel behaviour change during different seasons? In developing countries like India where land use distribution is complex, do travel characteristics have a relationship with spatial regions of different land use? And what is the influence of people from nearby sub-urban and villages on the passenger mobility of urban areas if transit service is provided? Hence, this study developed a methodology to visualise and analyse spatiotemporal variations in the bus passenger travel behaviour among different spatial regions at hourly, daily, and monthly temporal resolutions using non-negative tensor decomposition (NTD). Six-month electronic ticketing machine (ETM) data of the Davangere city bus service is collected. Land use data is also collected from the urban development authority of Davangere city. NTD was found efficient in extracting spatiotemporal patterns. From the analysis, it is observed that passenger mobility patterns across different spatial regions varied during different seasons and within a season as well. Pertaining to spatial variations, passenger origins and destinations are aggregated with respect to spatial regions with uniform land use or similar travel characteristics without giving any geographical inputs. Also, the mobility pattern of sub-urban and village people varied unconventionally. Thus, developed research methodology has the potential of unveiling the spatiotemporal variations in passenger mobility, which can act as a base for designing transit facilities and framing policies.

AB COVID-19 has caused huge disruptions to urban travel and mobility. As a critical transportation mode in cities, public transit was hit hardest. In this study, we analyze public transit usage of urban visitors with a nearly twoyear smart card dataset collected in Jeju, South Korea - a major tourism city in the Asia Pacific. The dataset captures transit usage behavior of millions of domestic visitors who traveled to Jeju between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. By identifying a few key pandemic stages based on COVID-19 timeline, we employ ridge regression models to investigate the impact of pandemic severity on transit ridership. We then derive a set of mobility indicators - from perspectives of trip frequency, spatial diversity, and travel range - to quantify how individual visitors used the transit system during their stay in Jeju. By further employing time series decomposition, we extract the trend component for each mobility indicator to study long-term dynamics of visitors' mobility behavior. According to the regression analysis, the pandemic had a dampening effect on public transit ridership. The overall ridership was jointly affected by national and local pandemic situations. The time series decomposition result reveals a long-term decay of individual transit usage, hinting that visitors in Jeju tended to use the transit system more conservatively as the pandemic endured. The study provides critical insights into urban visitors' transit usage behavior during the pandemic and sheds light on how to restore tourism, public transit usage, and overall urban vibrancy with some policy suggestions.

AB In recent decades, transit-oriented development (TOD) has been considered as an effective way to alleviate the negative impacts of rapid urbanization. The ridership of rail stations is an important indicator for understanding the relationship between rail transit and land use, which helps enhance their coordinated development. How to regulate such development is a fundamental question that planning of rail stations and surrounding land use endeavors to answer. Understanding the relationship between rail transit and land use is the basis of effective planning. From smart card data (SCD), the boarding and alighting ridership time series can be extracted to understand their relationship from a new perspective. Current studies mainly consider the temporal similarity of ridership time series between individual stations but ignore spatial dependency between a station and its adjacent stations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel method for refining the understanding from a spatiotemporal similarity perspective. First, we measure the temporal similarity of ridership time series between two individual stations using the autocorrelation function method. Second, we determine the spatiotemporal similarity between two stations by integrating the temporal similarity from their adjacent stations based on spatial dependency. Finally, the extracted spatiotemporal similarity is used for spectral clustering. As a case study, we analyze SCD on five consecutive weekdays at 289 rail stations in Shanghai, China. The land use functions of rail station areas are classified into 6 clusters: employment-oriented stations, residential-oriented stations, mixed stations, etc. By comparing the enrichment factors of each type of points of interest (POIs) in these clusters, the dominant land use function between our classification and POI information is demonstrated to be consistent. Furthermore, using three clustering performance indexes and several typical stations, the priority of our proposed method with integration of the spatial dependency can be confirmed to be superior to those without considering such important information. We conclude that the proposed method and findings are beneficial to balancing the needs of public transportation development and promoting the integration of transportation and land use for TOD implementation.

AB Accurate short-term passenger flow prediction plays an important role in transit plan-ning and operation. Existing research is mostly based on a joint modelling approach in which transit demand is predicted in an aggregated manner taking the overall passenger flow as input. A critical problem for the joint modelling approach is that the complexity of passenger flow composition and the distinct behavioural response to influential factors are missing out. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a separate modelling approach for passenger flow prediction based on behavioural patterns. To this end, we develop a novel hybrid decision tree (HDT) model coupled with a decision tree model and time series model. The upper layer is a decision tree model, in which the dataset is divided according to passenger types and influential factors, while the lower layer is the time series model achieved by the recurrent neural network. Particularly, this research first undertakes passenger classification using smartcard data through cluster analysis, from which the correlation between the classified passenger flow and influential factors is obtained. The proposed method is tested in a real-life bus route in Guangzhou, China. We also investigate the impact of passenger classification schemes and the minimum amount of data contained by leaf nodes on the performance of the HDT model. Based on this, we recommend the best classification scheme and the optimal value of the minimum amount of data contained by leaf nodes. Comparisons show that our method outperforms other traditional methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and stability. In addition, our method could also provide the prediction of passenger flow composition, which provides more references for customized bus service design.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of longitudinal travel data enables investigating how mobility patterns vary across the population and identify the spatial properties thereof. The objective of this study is to identify the extent to which users explore different parts of the network as well as identify distinctive user groups in terms of the spatial extent of their mobility patterns. To this end, we propose two means for representing spatial mobility profiles and clustering travellers accordingly. We represent users patterns in terms of zonal visiting frequency profiles and grid-cells spatial extent heatmaps. We apply the proposed analysis to a large-scale multi-modal mobility dataset from the public transport system in Stockholm, Sweden. We unravel three clusters -Locals, Commuters and Explorers -that best describe the zonal visiting frequency and show that their composition varies considerably across users' place of residence. We also identify 15 clusters of visiting spatial extent based on the intensity and direction in which they are oriented. A cross-analysis of the results of the two clustering methods reveals that user segmentation based on exploration patterns and spatial extent are largely independent, indicating that the two different clustering approaches provide fundamentally different insights into the underlying spatial properties of individuals' mobility patterns. The approach proposed and demonstrated in this study could be applied for any longitudinal individual travel demand data.

AB Several cities around the world rely on urban rail transit systems composed of interconnected lines, serving massive numbers of passengers on a daily basis. Accessing the location of passengers is essential to ensure the efficient and safe operation and planning of these systems. However, passenger route choices between origin and destination pairs are variable, depending on the subjective perception of travel and waiting times, required transfers, convenience factors, and on-site vehicle arrivals. This work proposes a robust methodology to estimate passenger route choices based only on automated fare collection data, i.e. without privacy-invasive sensors and monitoring devices. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require precise train timetable information or prior route choice models, and is robust to unforeseen operational events like malfunctions and delays. Train arrival times are inferred from passenger volume spikes at the exit gates, and the likelihood of eligible routes per passenger estimated based on the alignment between vehicle location and the passenger timings of entrance and exit. Applying this approach to automated fare collection data in Lisbon, we find that while in most cases passengers preferred the route with the least transfers, there were a significant number of cases where the shorter distance was preferred. Our findings are valuable for decision support among rail operators in various aspects such as passenger traffic bottleneck resolution, train allocation and scheduling, and placement of services.

AB Accurate prediction of short-term origin-destination (OD) matrix is crucial for operations in metro systems. Recently, some deep learning-based models have been proposed for OD matrix forecasting in ride-hailing or high-way scenarios. However, the metro OD matrix forecasting receives less attention, and it has different prior knowledge and complex spatiotemporal contextual setting; for example, the sparse destination distribution and the incomplete OD matrices collection in recent time intervals due to unfinished trips before the predicted time interval. This paper designs a deep learning approach for metro OD matrix prediction by addressing the recent destination distribution availability, augmenting the flow presentation for each station, and digging out the global spatial dependency and multiple temporal scale correlations in the mobility patterns of metro passengers. Specifically, it first proposes to complete the recent OD matrices by combining some empirical knowledge including the historical mobility pattern and arrival time distribution. Then, it learns the complementary spatiotemporal contextual features by embedding methods to enrich the station representation. Finally, it captures global mobility trend of metro passengers at each origin station through aggregating the trend of all other origin stations by self-attention mechanism since the mobility synchronizes among stations from spatial perspective. Three temporal convolutional networks are leveraged to extract three temporal trends in passenger mobility data, i.e., recent trend, daily trend, and weekly trend. Smart card data from Shenzhen and Hangzhou metro systems are utilized to demonstrate the superiority of our model over other competitors.

ID CHOICE; MODEL
AB As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues, many protective measures have been taken in Seoul, Korea, and around the world. This situation has drastically changed lifestyle and travel behavior. An important issue concerns understanding the reasons for giving up transit use and the potential impact on travel patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. To shed light on these issues that are essential for transit policy, this study explores transit use choice, such as whether users have given-up transit use or not, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two days of smart card data, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, were used to look at users who gave up transit use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The choice set of the dataset includes two alternatives, for example, transit use and given-up transit use. An extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model was used to estimate the transit use behavior. Shapley additive explanations were performed to interpret the estimation results of the XGB model. The results for the overall specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy of the proposed XGB model were estimated to be 0.909, 0.953, and 0.931, respectively. The feature analysis based on the Shapley value shows that the number of origin-to-destination trip feature substantially impacts transit use. As such, users tend to avoid transit use as travel time increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed model shows remarkable performance in accuracy and provided an understanding of the estimated results.

ID ALGORITHM; MATRIX
AB Smart card data are widely used in generating the origin and destination (O-D) matrix for public transit, which contains important information for transportation planning and operation. However, the generation of the O-D matrix is limited by the smart card data information that includes the boarding (origin) information without the alighting (destination) information. To solve this problem, trip chain methods have been proposed, thereby greatly contributing in estimating the destination using the smart card data. Nevertheless, unlinked trips, that is, trips with unknown destinations, are a persisting issue. The purpose of this study is to develop a method for estimating the destination of unlinked trips, in which trip chain methods cannot be applied, using temporal travel patterns and historical boarding records of the passengers based on long-term smart card data. The passengers were clustered by k-means clustering, and the time-of-day travel patterns were estimated for each cluster using a Gaussian mixture model. The travel patterns were formulated to estimate the destination of the passengers from the smart card data. The proposed method was verified using the 2018 smart card data collected in Sejong City, South Korea. The existing trip chain method matched the destinations of 60.0% of the total trips, whereas the proposed method improved the matching to 74.9% by additionally matching the destinations of 37.2% of the unlinked trips.

AB Public transit is a major mode of urban mobility in Macao, a compact and populous city in China. Public transit ridership is related to round-the-clock shift-based work arrangements in the gaming industry. Smartcards that are used in transit fare collection are a vital data source for understanding the travel patterns and characteristics of transit passengers. However, transactional information from single data sources is fragmented, hindering the extraction of mobility patterns. We proposed a trip-pair-based clustering model that extracts the within-day mobility patterns of bus riders. DBSCAN is employed to filter scattered trips and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to identify clusters. Using a six-month smartcard dataset from Macao, categories of bus passengers were identified. Travel patterns exist with irregular, one-way, and round-trip passengers, and shift workers. The unique shift-based work-life and mixed travel modes in Macao can serve as an example of dense and compact city travel for smart cities.

AB With the rapid increase in the availability of passive data in the field of transportation, combining machine learning with transportation models has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. This study proposes an entropy Tucker model that integrates (1) a Tucker decomposition technique, i.e., an existing machine learning method, and (2) an entropy maximizing model, i.e., an existing model used for modeling trip distribution in the field of transportation. In addition, an optimization algorithm is presented to empirically identify the proposed model. The proposed model provides a solid theoretical foundation for the machine learning method, substantially improves prediction performance, and provides richer behavioral implications through empirical parameter estimation of travel impedance. We conducted a case study using public transit smart card data. The results showed that the proposed model improves the prediction performance and interpretability of the results compared to the conventional nonnegative Tucker decomposition technique. Further, we empirically confirmed that the travel impedance varies with the origin-destination pair, time of the day, and day of the week. Finally, we discussed how embedding the theoretical foundations of transport modeling into machine learning methods can facilitate the use of various passive data in wider practical contexts of transport policy decision making.

AB Drawing on transit smart card data and weather station records over a 12-month period, this study investigates the influence of local weather conditions on public transit ridership in Brisbane, Australia. Based on the statistical distribution of transit ridership, this study applies a suite of geographically weighted negative binomial regression models to capture the weather-transit ridership relationship at both daily and half-hourly levels. The results reveal that weather exerts significant effects on transit ridership; its effects vary by passenger type and are not fixed across locations and temporal periods. In general, senior passengers are the most sensitive group to variations in weather conditions, and their responses are quite similar across the public transit service area. Morning peak hours are the period when passengers have the strongest weather tolerance. Spatial heterogeneity of weather effects mainly occurs in adult, child, and tertiary student passengers, not seniors and secondary student passengers. In contrast to suburban areas, city centres and university campuses are the locales most likely to have distinct weather responses. The results suggest that it is important for transit operators to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the weather-transit ridership relationship to proactively (re)design and adjust scheduling to achieve weather-resilient performance.

AB Few studies have analyzed individuals' travel route characteristics in the integrated metro and bikeshare network. Taking Nanjing, China, as a case study, this paper analyzes the combined travel route of metrobikeshare users based on three-week metroand shared bike smart card data. The smart card data provides both boarding/borrowing and alighting/returning location and time, which makes it possible to trace each combined mode user's actual metro routes. By assuming that the bike routes are the shortest paths between a specific OD pair from smart card records, we extract the combined metro-bikeshare travel routes of each user by using a metro route reconstruction method. The results show that over 60% of the metro-bikeshare users, most of whom are youth adults (18-35 years old), only occasionally use this mode. Further, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the combined metro-bikeshare travel routes are analyzed visually across different age groups. We find that most of the combined metro-bikeshare routes concentrated on Metro Line 2 with different cycling access/egress routes; however, the routes mostly travelled by different age groups are significantly different. Young adults are mainly distributed in suburban and exurban areas. Adults are more likely to be metro-bikeshare commuters, with travel routes usually passing through the central area of the city. Besides, the routes mostly travelled by the elderly are longer than those by other groups, and highly coincide with the routes mostly travelled by adults during the rush hours. Finally, relevant policy implementations are proposed in conjunction with metro-bikeshare users' travel route characteristics.

AB Precise forecasts on individual accessibility in bus system can help make policies to accommodate fluctuating bus travel demand and promoting social equity. In this study, we propose a three-stage method for short-term forecasts on individual accessibility in bus system based on neural network (NN) model. In the first stage, a NN model is designed to tackle the nonlinear mapping between passengers' bus trip appearances in historical periods and those in the predicted period. A rate function, which considers bus trip generation rates of passengers, is then applied using outputs of the designed NN model. In the second stage, probabilities of origindestinations (ODs) chosen by passengers in the predicted period are calculated. In the third stage, land use information combined with results of previous two stages are used to obtain the individual accessibility in bus system in the predicted period. Compared to individual accessibility calculated by real data, it is found that the average errors of predicted results by the proposed method in weekdays and at weekends are only 8.37% and 10.13%, respectively. The results also demonstrate the capability of combining a NN model, traffic data and land use information to forecast the future spatial distribution of individual accessibility in transport system.

AB This paper analyzes public transit mobility of different economic classes of Curitiba, Brazil, exploring an official smart card dataset provided by the city. With the population divided into subsets corresponding to economic strata, we characterized vital spatial-temporal transit usage patterns, such as departure times and destinations reached by different economic classes. We also constructed a network representing the common origin and destination of public transit users, enabling discovering distinct patterns. Among the results, we observe that with the increase in wealth, the morning activity is postponed (on average for 2 h), and the spatial distribution of the trips becomes more localized compared with lower classes. We also show that our model captures fairly well realistic mobility patterns exploring a cheaper and larger-scale data source by comparing our results with a household travel survey from Curitiba. Understand how people in different economic classes appropriate urban spaces help to provide subsidies for, e.g., more sustainable economic development propositions.

TI Assessing the Evolution of Transit User Behavior from Smart Card Data

ID PASSENGER FLOW; TRANSPORT
AB There is a huge potential for exploiting information centered on individual transit users' behavior through longitudinal smart card data. This is particularly true for cities like Gatineau, Canada, where the bus system serves passengers with different travel patterns. Understanding the evolution of these patterns marks an important point in improving transit demand forecasting models. Indeed, better models can help transit planners to create optimized networks. This paper proposes a comparison of a traditional and an experimental methodology aiming to identify the evolution of travel structure among transit users. These methodologies are based on the clustering of multi-week travel patterns derived from a large sample of smart card transactions (35.4 million). Representing users' behavior, these patterns are constructed using the number of trips made by every card on each day of a week. Behavior vectors are defined by seven components (one for each day) and are clustered using a K-means algorithm. The experimental week-to-week method consists in clustering the population on each week, while using the clustering results from the previous week as seed. This latter approach makes it possible to observe the evolution of users' behaviors and also has a better clustering quality in a similar computation time than the traditional method.

To quantify, monitor and visualise the TSAs of the Southeast Queensland (SEQ), this study analyses half-year smartcard data between 2012 and 2013 from TransLink, the transit agency for SEQ. Four scenarios are prescribed and four corresponding metrics (the minimum, actual, random and maximum travels) are calculated, which reflect transit riders' different levels of elasticity of distance travelled (EDT) relative to the cost of travel within or between TSAs and how transit riders could possibly travel as EDT varies. The total trips generated by or attracted to TSA and the temporal and spatial variations of these metrics across days are used to monitor TSAs, especially transit trips within or between them. The results indicate that transit trips attracted to, and generated by TSA and transit trips between TSAs vary significantly over time and across space. Across the scenarios, the temporal variance tends to be larger as EDT becomes more inelastic. The above results provide useful references for decision-makers to understand better the ranges of transit demand (by TSA) across the space and time when EDT is a variable.

AB Commuting patterns where most if not all 'trips are optimised relative to a given distribution of jobs and housing can result in personal and socio-economic benefits. Excess commuting indicators provide useful information for academics and policy analysts to evaluate how the actual commuting pattern deviates from an optimal pattern where commuting costs are minimised. While actual commuting patterns vary from day-to-day, academic researchers have yet to quantify the temporal variation in these indicators over short time periods. This may be due to the lack of available longitudinal data as input for excess commuting indicators. This study shows that new, open and/or big data (NOBD) (e.g. smartcard data) can be exploited to serve as the input for such analysis. In this regard, our study uses half a year's worth of smartcard data from Brisbane, Australia to first derive/aggregate origins and destinations by small areas of the probable commuting trips by transit on all 122 weekdays over the study period. The study quantifies the day-to-day variation in excess commuting indicators for these trips and finds that excess commuting indicators vary considerably from one day to the next. Nevertheless, daily variations occur within a relatively consistent range which can be planned for. Our research suggests that more conscious and systematic utilisation of NOBD could change how commuting flows in cities are quantified, monitored and planned. In addition, with NOBD, we can more efficiently detect daily outliers in commuting patterns.

AB Passenger flow prediction is important for the operation, management, efficiency, and reliability of urban rail transit (subway) system. Here, we employ the large-scale subway smart-card data of Shenzhen, a major city of China, to predict dynamical passenger flows in the subway network. Four classical predictive models: historical average model, multilayer perceptron neural network model, support vector regression model, and gradient boosted regression trees model, were analyzed. Ordinary and anomalous traffic conditions were identified for each subway station by using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The prediction accuracy of each predictive model was analyzed under ordinary and anomalous traffic conditions to explore the high-performance condition (ordinary traffic condition or anomalous traffic condition) of different predictive models. In addition, we studied how long in advance that passenger flows can be accurately predicted by each predictive model. Our finding highlights the importance of selecting proper models to improve the accuracy of passenger flow prediction, and that inherent patterns of passenger flows are more prominently influencing the accuracy of prediction.

DT Article
DE Individual mobility; Next trip prediction; Smart card data; Bayesian
   n-gram model
AB For intelligent urban transportation systems, the ability to predict individual mobility is crucial for personalized traveler information, targeted demand management, and dynamic system operations. Whereas existing methods focus on predicting the next location of users, little is known regarding the prediction of the next trip. The paper develops a methodology for predicting daily individual mobility represented as a chain of trips (including the null set, no travel), each defined as a combination of the trip start time t, origin o, and destination d. To predict individual mobility, we first predict whether the user will travel (trip making prediction), and then, if so, predict the attributes of the next trip (t,o,d) (trip attribute prediction). Each of the two problems can be further decomposed into two subproblems based on the triggering event. For trip attribute prediction, we propose a new model, based on the Bayesian n-gram model used in language modeling, to estimate the probability distribution of the next trip conditional on the previous one. The proposed methodology is tested using the pseudonymized transit smart card records from more than 10,000 users in London, U.K. over two years. Based on regularized logistic regression, our trip making prediction models achieve median accuracy levels of over 80%. The prediction accuracy for trip attributes varies by the attribute considered-around 40% for t, 70-80% for o and 60-70% for d. Relatively, the first trip of the day is more difficult to predict. Significant variations are found across individuals in terms of the model performance, implying diverse travel behavior patterns.

ID ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRIX; DATA-COLLECTION SYSTEMS
AB Automatic fare collection (AFC) systems have been widely used all around the world which record rich data resources for researchers mining the passenger behavior and operation estimation. However, most transit systems are open systems for which only boarding information is recorded but the alighting information is missing. Because of the lack of trip information, validation of utility functions for passenger choices is difficult. To fill the research gaps, this study uses the AFC data from Beijing metro, which is a closed system and records both boarding information and alighting information. To estimate a more reasonable utility function for choice modeling, the study uses the trip chaining method to infer the actual destination of the trip. Based on the land use and passenger flow pattern, applying k-means clustering method, stations are classified into 7 categories. A trip purpose labelling process was proposed considering the station category, trip time, trip sequence, and alighting station frequency during five weekdays. We apply multinomial logit models as well as mixed logit models with independent and correlated normally distributed random coefficients to infer passengers' preferences for ticket fare, walking time, and in-vehicle time towards their alighting station choice based on different trip purposes. The results find that time is a combined key factor while the ticket price based on distance is not significant. The estimated alighting stations are validated with real choices from a separate sample to illustrate the accuracy of the station choice models.

AB The primary objective of this study was to investigate the bikesharing travel patterns and trip purposes by combining smart card data and online point of interests (POIs). A large-scale smart card trip data was collected from the bikesharing system in New York City. The POIs surrounding each station were obtained from Google Places API. K-means clustering analysis was first applied to divide bikesharing stations into five types based on their surrounding POIs. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis was then conducted to discover the hidden bikesharing travel patterns and trip purposes using the identified station types and smart card data. The performance of the LDA models with and without POI data was compared to identify whether the POI data should be used. Finally, a practical application of the proposed methods in bikesharing planning and operation was discussed. The result of comparative analyses verified the importance of POI data in exploring bikesharing travel patterns and trip purposes. The results of LDA model showed that the most prevalent travel purpose in New York City is taking public bike for eating, followed by shopping and transferring to other public transit systems. In addition, the result also suggested that people living around the bikesharing stations are more likely to transfer to other commuting tools on the morning peak and ride for home after work. The proposed methods can be used to provide useful guidance and suggestions for transportation agency to develop strategies and regulation that aim at improving the operations of bikesharing systems.

AB In this article, we propose a transit service Feeder to tackle the last-mile problem, that is, passengers' destinations lay beyond a walking distance from a public transit station. Feeder utilizes ridesharing-based vehicles (e.g., minibus) to deliver passengers from existing transit stations to selected stops closer to their destinations. We infer real-time passenger demand (e.g., exiting stations and times) for Feeder design by utilizing extreme-scale urban infrastructures, which consist of 10 million cellphones, 27 thousand vehicles, and 17 thousand smartcard readers for 16 million smartcards in a Chinese city, Shenzhen. Regarding these numerous devices as pervasive sensors, we mine both online and offline data for a two-end Feeder service: a back-end Feeder server to calculate service schedules and front-end customized Feeder devices in vehicles for real-time schedule downloading. We implement Feeder using a fleet of vehicles with customized hardware in a subway station of Shenzhen by collecting data for 30 days. The evaluation results show that compared to the ground truth, Feeder reduces last-mile distances by 68% and travel time by 56%, on average.

AB As a pinnacle of green transportation with transit attributes, bikesharing has become particularly popular since the mid-2000s. Taking the opportunity of accessing to a large-scale and smart-card-based dataset from Nanjing, China, this paper explores bikesharing travel time and trip chain patterns by gender and day of the week. Bikesharing trip chain is defined and classified into four types according to the complexity of chain. Z-score analysis and visual analytic techniques, as well as chi-statistic, are adopted to explore the variation of bikesharing travel time and trip chain. The results suggest that the residential areas are the primary fountainhead where bikesharing demands generate, whilst the rail stations are the most attractive hubs that the bikesharing trips terminate at. The travel time between the same bikesharing station can be two times longer than it is from one station to another. Bikesharing travel time also differs significantly in terms of gender and day of the week. With respect to bikesharing trip chain patterns, significant variation is observed between men and women, as well as between weekdays and weekends. Findings indicate that women are more likely to make multiple-circle bikesharing trip chains than men, especially on weekdays. Moreover, the visual analytic gives bikesharing operators direct sense of the variation of bikesharing trip chain patterns with respect to gender and day of the week. Last but not least, this paper finds that there is big gap between bikesharing demand and supply in the adjacent area of rail stations in Nanjing, in particular, during afternoon peak hours.

AB The aim of this study is to develop a data fusion methodology for estimating behavioural attributes of trips using smart card data to observe continuous long-term changes in the attributes of trips. The method is intended to enhance understanding of travellers' behaviour during monitoring the smart card data. In order to supplement absent behavioural attributes in the smart card data, this study developed a data fusion methodology of smart card data with the person trip survey data with the naive Bayes probabilistic model. A model for estimating the trip purpose is derived from the person trip survey data. By using the model, trip purposes are estimated as supplementary behavioural attributes of the trips observed in the smart card data. The validation analysis showed that the proposed method successfully estimated the trip purposes in 86.2% of the validation data. The empirical data mining analysis showed that the proposed methodology can be applied to find and interpret the behavioural features observed in the smart card data which had been difficult to obtain from each independent dataset.

AB Transit agencies implement many strategies in order to provide an attractive transportation service. This article aims to evaluate the impacts of implementing a combination of strategies, designed to improve the bus transit service, on running time and passenger satisfaction. These strategies include using smart card fare collection, introducing limited-stop bus service, implementing reserved bus lanes, using articulated buses, and implementing transit signal priority (TSP). This study uses stop-level data collected from the Societe de transport de Montreal (STM)'s automatic vehicle location (AVL) and automatic passenger count (APC) systems, in Montreal, Canada. The combination of these strategies has lead to a 10.5% decline in running time along the limited stop service compared to the regular service. The regular route running time has increased by 1% on average compared to the initial time period. The study also shows that riders are generally satisfied with the service improvements. They tend to overestimate the savings associated with the implementation of this combination of strategies by 3.5-6.0 min and by 2.5-4.1 min for both the regular route and the limited stop service, respectively. This study helps transit planners and policy makers to better understand the effects of implementing a combination of strategies to improve running time and passenger's perception of these changes in service.

TI Analyzing Passenger Incidence Behavior in Heterogeneous Transit Services
   Using Smartcard Data and Schedule-Based Assignment
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID RELIABILITY; INSIGHTS
AB Passenger incidence (station arrival) behavior has been studied primarily to understand how changes to a transit service will affect passenger waiting times. The impact of one intervention (e.g., increasing frequency) could be overestimated when compared with another (e.g., improving reliability), depending on the assumption of incidence behavior. Understanding passenger incidence allows management decisions to be based on realistic behavioral assumptions. Earlier studies on passenger incidence chose their data samples from stations with a single service pattern such that the linking of passengers to services was straightforward. This choice of data samples simplifies the analysis but heavily limits the stations that can be studied. In any moderately complex network, many stations may have more than one service pattern. This limitation prevents the method from being systematically applied to the whole network and constrains its use in practice. This paper considers incidence behavior in stations with heterogeneous services and proposes a method for estimating incidence headway and waiting time by integrating disaggregate smartcard data with published timetables using schedule-based assignment. This method is applied to stations in the entire London Overground to demonstrate its practicality; incidence behavior varies across the network and across times of day and reflects headways and reliability. Incidence is much less timetable-dependent on the North London Line than on the other lines because of shorter headways and poorer reliability. Where incidence is timetable-dependent, passengers reduce their mean scheduled waiting time by more than 3 min compared with random incidence.
